Paying someone else's mortgage for them! Spare me. It's simple economics with a blind spot for morality, with no provision for social cohesion. I was renting from 1 man who had a portfolio of 80 small properties, effectively a modern slum Lord. 80 properties off the market, to line his pockets and keep me and others in the rental trap a little longer. He isn't the only person doing this, I read about a married couple with 900 properties.
