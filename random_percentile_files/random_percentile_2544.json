Further, the democrat pipe dream claim that \"\"\"\"Russia hacked the machines\"\"\"\" to rig the outcome is IMPOSSIBLE as the machines are NEVER connected to the internet, nor each other. Even further still, a RECOUNT is just that, a RECOUNT. It will do NOTHING to show there was improprieties, for THAT you would need a FULL AUDIT of the registry rolls compared to the ballots cast... something the DEMOCRATS have been fighting since they unilaterally and without any justification REACTIVATED MILLIONS of dormant registrations, which resulted in, according to PEW Research some 24 million anomalous registrations, which include 3 million dead people and 7 million persons with at least TWO conflicting active registrations. Then, let's just look at how this REALLY panned out with the popular vote: There are 3,141 counties in the United States. Trump won 3,084 of them. Clinton won 57. There are 62 counties in New York State. Trump won 46 of them. Clinton won 16. Clinton won the popular vote by approx. 1.5 million votes. In the 5 counties that encompass NYC, (Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Richmond & Queens) Clinton received well over 2 million more votes than Trump. (Clinton only won 4 of these counties; Trump won Richmond) Therefore 4 of these 5 counties alone, more than accounted for Clinton winning the popular vote of the entire country. These 5 counties comprise 319 square miles. The United States is comprised of 3, 797,000 square miles.
