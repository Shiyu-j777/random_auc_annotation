So when two black holes collide, you just get one, bigger black hole. You can think of it as the larger one absorbing the smaller, but unless there's a huge size difference, it's more of a mutual event. The energy calculations are due to the way mass/energy is released upon crossing the event horizon, I believe. When matter crosses the event horizon, some of it flashes away as high energy waves; if you have two /massive/ objects colliding, a lot of energy would be released. As to how the calculated how much energy, I have no idea. They have years of higher math, I have one.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0914,"user_ideo":-0.4706,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.18,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":92},{"user_id":1313375525339355,"comment_id":1331705926858683,"date":"2016-08-05","message":"yet again, the liberal democrats have to turn it into an event all about them and racism.

The House Republicans CUT the funding for embassy security by $128 million in fiscal 2011 and $331 million in fiscal year 2012, which places the BLAME of the attack on the Republican Congress on shoulders. Furthermore, Hillary Clinton warned the STINGY Republicans that the embassy BUDGET CUTS were \"\"\"\"DETRIMENTAL to America's NATIONAL SECURITY,\"\"\"\" and they IGNORED her warning. That's right the entire crusade against Hillary Clinton has been nothing more than a SHAME by DONALD TRUMP and the REPUBLICAN PARTY in order to hurt Clinton's chances at office, all on the TAXPAYERS' DIME!!

Trump? He sure isn't. And yup all those things Michael are at stake! That's why I'm worried Clinton supported the no child left behind in the early 2000s and then discredited it when she ran on 2008, discredited foreign deals like the Colombian free trade deal and then supported it again when she ran in 2008, was opposed to same sex marriage for the longest time and surprise surprise now she supports it, stated that in the future we were going to depend mostly on oil then she said we should look at Iraq as a business opportunity because of their oil which makes me think that's why she voted for the war, and we all know what happened with the whole email deal so I shouldn't have to mention it... Is not that I don't believe democrats have a better idea of how to run office, my problem is with her... She might be saying something today but we are not so sure what she will say tomorrow. And again I am more inclined towards her on this election but only because like some of you said, trump will send us to the stone age.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0018,"user_ideo":-0.1176,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":92},{"comment_id":631834196995253,"date":"2016-10-29","message":"I will be voting Democrat all the way.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.01,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":92},{"user_id":10206795386270597,"comment_id":10152817526424877,"date":"2015-01-29","message":"Happy Birthday!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5167,"user_ideo":-0.7452,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.54,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":92},{"user_id":1740368976283641,"comment_id":10156221117435603,"date":"2015-11-07","message":"Just like racism I have to be taught","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3541,"user_ideo":-0.1805,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.42,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":92}]
