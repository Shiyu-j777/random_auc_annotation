I mean when you come out supporting Sanders, calling Trump a liberal, is almost laughable! The fact is, Donald Trump, couldnt possibly be worse than what we have & sure as hell couldnt be worse than Hillary Clinton! He is successful, his children are well manered & successful in their own right, I believe he really does love America & will do what he says. He doesnt take any crap, doesnt apologize and well heeled to address the issues of our economy & trade.

We are so glad to hear your story as we'd like to have a demonstration to support the sanctity of marriage. As I am sure you know, the same portions of His word referencing foul homosexuality as a sin also state a wife is to always obey her husband's desires and never to as much as disagree, else face stoning. How delighted we were to find out about you doing the Lord's work, let alone a multi-time divorcee. Please join us in a stoning ceremony. Does tomorrow or Thursday work better for you? Yes, for Jesus, you can demonstrate that His law and love are above man's! While you may suffer severe injury, the eternal blessings are well worth the cost. In advance, thank you! We know all you do to uphold God's law is difficult and you are shunned for it, but it will pay you back tenfold. In His loving name, Rev. B.E.
