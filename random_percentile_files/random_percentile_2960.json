The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated! Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump..... \"\"\"\"We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him. The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed! We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out. This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation. Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar. Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.7992,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":1,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":2960},{"comment_id":10154255808533984,"date":"2016-04-03","message":"Trump is not my first choice, neither is Cruz.

The Democratic Party, CNN, MSNBC, FOX News? Although there have been some people that have committed suicide, just as Doctors, Lawyers or any walk of life. That does not mean all people are suicidal. Nor are all men or women crazy. Your comment about a gun being dangerous in the house tells most of us that grew up around guns that you have no clue. I grew up around guns during a time when one could order guns from a catalog, mail order. A time when guns were stored in open glass cases without locks. We learned not only how to use them, we learned to respect them and always treat them as if they were loaded, a time when many of us used them to feed our families. The second amendment was instituted by our founding fathers to protect one from intruders, but it was primarily to protect us against tyrant invaders, foreign and domestic. Do I think I could take on an army all by myself? No, I do not. However you seem to be out of touch with the reality that there are millions of patriots and people that took an oath to uphold the constitution of our nation. So when you ask if I alone could defend against an army? There is an army numbering in the millions that will be standing with me. So, you are the one that needs to understand and see the whole picture. There was prohibition, did that work? The powers that be could never stop the production of liquor. There has been laws to stop marijuana, was that successful? Absolutely not. There are laws to stop moonshine and that's also been going on for centuries, has that stopped? No! So don't be ignorant about guns and gun control. It isn't about gun control and never has been, it's about people control. You've been listening to too many stories and propaganda. There are far more people saved by legal concealed carry people than you know. The media will never report those saved by those that legally carry weapons. Laugh all you want that tell all of us either In law enforcement or military the ignorance behind your statements. I will only agree with you on one point. We need better ways to keep the criminals from obtaining guns. Then again there was recently an attack in a mall by a deranged man using a knife and he was finally stopped by a legal gun. So what are we going to do, restrict all knifes? Common sense appears to be sadly lacking with many. I'm sure that if the SHTF you'd be one of those sitting down too afraid to pick up a firearm, so I suggest you take a seat and let those of us willing to defend your right to the first amendment and keep quiet till then.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9964,"user_ideo":0.3197,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.94,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":2960}]
