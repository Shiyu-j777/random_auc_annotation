Who was the last American killed by Russia? However this same Administration consider Saudi Arabia our ally, yet they are accused of funding the 9/11 attack that killed over 3000 Americans. I've had the privilege of visiting both the former USSR Republic of Ukraine in 1992 and Cuba in 2011. In both places, I was asked, \"\"\"\"Why do Americans hate us so much?\"\"\"\". In both places I asked the question; \"\"\"\"Why do you believe we hate you?\"\"\"\". In both places the answer was the same, \"\"\"\"That is what our government tells us.\"\"\"\" So is Russia our enemy? Who is our enemy? During the Democratic debates that question was posed to the five Democratic Candidates. Some said NRA; some said Wall-street; I remember Clinton's answer - Republican Party. Senator Jim Webb said, the soldier who tried to kill me with a grenade, but he's not around anymore. Most candidates could not differentiate between \"\"\"\"opponents\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"enemies\"\"\"\". Only one candidate knew the different and that was US Veteran Jim Webb... an enemy is someone who is trying to kill or harm you. Russia is doing neither - so why is this Administration trying to get us to believe that Russia is our enemy and that Trump is cooperating with the enemy? So I ask you the question I asked those who became my friends in both Ukraine and Cuba... why do you believe Russia is our enemy? They are opponents, but at this point they are not our enemy. More importantly, why the Media Propaganda to make us believe they are our enemy. Like what happened with other facts before... first the media said they hacked our election system. Now they are saying they hacked into DNC and influenced our election. I ask the question, do we as voters have a right to know what came out in Wikileaks? Why did our media did not investigate and report that information to the voters? More importantly, if they hacked into those systems as the CIA claims why are we not investigating how they hacked into Hillary Clinton's private server and what secret information they and others accessed that affected what happened in the Middle East?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9897,"user_ideo":0.1228,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.91,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1838},{"user_id":916351078492916,"comment_id":566611163525321,"date":"2016-07-13","message":"Put them in Chicago or Hollywood","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9986,"user_ideo":0.4288,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.96,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1838},{"user_id":1403311999685912,"comment_id":1669376616658937,"date":"2016-04-05","message":"You probably went to school the same time I did, and most of what we were taught were either outright lies or highly embellished and redacted.
