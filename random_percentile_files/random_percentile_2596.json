Here's how: Restoring Article 1 A Convention of the States under Article 5 of the United States Constitution, The first issue could be restoring Article I of the United States Constitution. When the founders created the Federal Government, and the Congress, They stated that the two entities must be represented equally, to serve \"\"\"\"We the People.\"\"\"\" They created House of Representatives, know as the PEOPLES HOUSE to represent the people in their districts. There is a reason why there is an election every two years for the House, if they are not serving their district well-they can be replaced quickly. The Senate was created to represent the RESPECTIVE STATES, in which we the people reside, the senators from 1792 to 1913 WERE NOT ELECTED by popular election, but faced election in their respective state legislatures and could be RECALLED by the Governor of the state if they were not properly representing their respective state. Today most Americans think of the United States Senators as representing us in Congress, when in fact THEY ACTUALLY DO NOT, and because of this, the members of the House are NOT PROPERLY not representing us either. Until we restore this key section (Article 1) of the constitution we will never completely get the National Governmant back on the right track. In addition to reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interests - the United States Senate is regarded by most as a country club and the senators often act contrary to the wishes of their State and more often align themselves with a national political party. We should return power over the Senate to the State Legislatures. Beyond that we have to introduce term limits for both the House and Senate. I hope you'll check out Convention of the States on FaceBook. We might not agree on much, but surely most can agree we need to take back control of our National Checkbook. A Balanced Budget Amendment, that'll reduce the influence of special interests and lobbyists. Then Congress has to listen to We The People, all year round-not just election season.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.7848,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":2596},{"user_id":1142957182436905,"comment_id":10154004035897577,"date":"2016-02-17","message":"We're Federal Firearms Laws violated.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9188,"user_ideo":0.6993,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.81,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":2596},{"user_id":344560825908840,"comment_id":10154566681778690,"date":"2016-08-16","message":"Afghanistan blames Pakistan for everything Taliban do in Afghanistan.
