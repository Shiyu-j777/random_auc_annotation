Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends, such are wrong-doers. 58:14 Hast thou not seen those who take for friends a folk with whom Allah is wroth ? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear a false oath knowingly. (58:14-15) Don't make friends with Allah's enemies. For those who do so, Allah has prepared a dreadful doom. And if you say that you don't take those verses seriously, you're condemned again: 34:5 But those who strive against Our revelations, challenging (Us), theirs will be a painful doom of wrath. And don't try to claim that the Qur'an doesn't command Muslims to kill the infidel: 39:60 And on the Day of Resurrection thou (Muhammad) seest those who lied concerning Allah with their faces blackened. Is not the home of the scorners in hell ? Because if you lie about it then again you're condemned. Because we all know it clearly tells Muslims to fight against and kill non believers: 47:4 Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.
