The first thing is to sit down and cry. It is the greatest tragedy in time that has brought us to a deadly final. We did abuse and murder the Creator's children in this heaven, the loveliest of his many splendid gardens. One can only wish back in time someone with intelligence would have held the hand that wanted to strike. One can only wish back in time a minister or priest would have bravely scoured and thrust his fist onto the alter and damned anyone for tormenting, abusing, robbing, harassing and murdering these lovely people. One wishes way back then that someone would have ran through the towns screaming bloody murderers, not Christian. Anything that may have snapped people out of their drunken stupor and seen the filth in them and knowing it is known, ugly and disgusting, it is not embraceable. A people with a book, they could have tried to live as clean people so that life could have been truly beautiful. Was it so hard to admit we didn't know a damn thing? We were a lost people without a home. What mercy was given to us, what tragedy we have known; seems rational, reasonable and intelligent to do everything to avoid any further disputes, wars, conflicts, ugly sin. We knew all of that. It should have been behind us, we should have made a way to put it behind us. A few honest groups did succeed - the Quakers went to go live in some peaceful way however imperfect, they were not the gun toting mauls of today or yesteryear. If people can look at shit and know its shit than why was it so hard to see the hand that did it? If we didn't need honesty, than honestly what did we need? A starvation for love and liberty so long till the starvation ate it away into impossibility. Same kingdom different location. No life to live or celebrate just endless death watches, marches, campaigns, penalties and punishments. What great beauty was here many will never know, many of us never saw - it already poisoned and put to death. What a magnificent heaven was truly here. North America was a divine lovely garden of spectacular wonder, a heaven of all heavens. There were beautiful people among us who could not stand the loveless dirty society, they ended their own lives, truly it was impossible to live. It is the hallmark of this gathering calling itself the nation, a society, collectively they remade life in their image, impossible to live - so many had to die. It is possible to build a wall - high enough and long enough and may it provide security - of having the millions of names inscribed into it whose lives were sacrificed, human sacrifices to an alter for a false God. A God of war, revenge, ravaging, raping, polluting and confiscating, a cruel God by any mean thing said and done. It had gold before it found the new power, uranium. Profit was the new Prophet in the old kingdom on a new land not belonging to those horrors forbidden and smashed down so long ago. Einstein emerges as the most brilliant citizen that may say a closing word for us all, he understood he made a mistake, an honest thought about what he had done. We honestly made a mistake in pretending that anything belonged to us but what we had done. I can not imagine what it must feel like to sit in that oval office, that big desk and chair, with name plate of chief placed in front of your reading material. To survey that room swiveling in that big chair getting a 360* view, stopping at the windows, those large windows, looking out, looking far out over it all - so much suffering, such inhumane conditions still present from the past, so many broken lives, body and soul, so many lies, so much destruction. A brave man with honor or woman of integrity would dissolve it. Give the people their own congress, laws, justice and decisions for liberty, the government had betrayed any value of truth a long time ago - that man or woman never sat at that desk and undoubtedly never will. The people have overwhelming in majority voted no confidence in the government. A government receiving a majority of no confidence voting from the public meant and still means, the government must step down, be dissolved until such time a new election can be agreed upon and by what structure or system to even be governed by. It was by some margin of faith the people may have redeemed themselves for the love of God and humanity, how different one can wish the tomorrows might have come.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0143,"user_ideo":-0.6649,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.06,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":2880},{"user_id":10210747610313291,"comment_id":1273437489419167,"date":"2016-08-29","message":"she's just as bad.... corrupt killary puppet :( throw her in jail","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9089,"user_ideo":0.2185,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.81,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":2880},{"user_id":10209702755027711,"comment_id":1858118717750316,"date":"2016-11-14","message":"Nobody has to give Trump that demeaned mocked and attacked every group of ppl in his campaign except those men that look like him a pass or chance if they don't want too.
