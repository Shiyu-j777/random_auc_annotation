I think his plan for taxes is brilliant and will help those with a much smaller income. I like that he hasn't been bought out by any lobbyists and has stated that he will not accept presidential salary. That alone speaks volumes. He believes what he is doing will be right for the country and he has no one whispering an agenda into his ear. I think his main focus is our country and not others.
