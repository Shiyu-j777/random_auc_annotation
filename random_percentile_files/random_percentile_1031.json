Instead, it will use the tribunals in that \"\"\"\"trade agreement\"\"\"\" to demand payment for what it expected it would have earned if it had built and operated the pipeline. Thus, the damages it claims are 15 billion. It will not need to demonstrate that it has standing in any normal sense. And, it will be seeking a judgement not from a U. S. judge, but an arbitrator who is a corporate attorney that can also practice as a litigator for the very corporations on which he/she sits in judgement. Outraged? Even more outrageous is this same provision in the mother of all trade agreements: TTP, now coming up for approval by the U. S. Congress, after it approved Fast Track Authority.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0017,"user_ideo":-0.8491,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1031},{"user_id":1389767951038553,"comment_id":866118916848560,"date":"2016-03-15","message":"I'll tell you why your government are dealing with the Isis oil ect and yous shot down aircrafts and pilots yes sorry for what's happened but when we see this then you said if yous don't get millions yous will unleash hundreds of thousands of refugees into Europe so really literally your blackmailing us that's why !!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9198,"user_ideo":-0.0685,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.81,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1031},{"user_id":1193002390763881,"comment_id":10154802361931509,"date":"2016-05-15","message":"Oh, how brave and courageous.
