It's about something us as black people have been dealing with since the 50s and 60s. It doesn't matter if your a drug dealer or a ceo of a fortune 500 company you are bound to be harassed by police beaten and/or posibly killed while in police custody. I have seen footage where a man got beat to death in a hospital bed by 5 police officers with Billy clubs. Footage of a man walking away from 2 officers being shot in the back. You will never know how it feels to walk in our shoes. I'm a college student and everytime I walk to school I worry if a officer is gonna pull up to me and harass me. There is a serious problem that people outside the urban community don't want to accept. A problem you fail to see that's right under your nose because it's something you don't have to go through. If a black man gets beat or killed by the police in the middle of the street you automatically think he's a thug that deserved it, being ignorant to the fact that he might be a Senate or a business owner or a professor or even a pastor. You do not know who that person is. So just because he is black doesn't mean he's just this thug or \"\"\"\"animal\"\"\"\" (as you all call it now) out trying to cause trouble. He could be your child's math teacher or school principle. There are a lot of people that do not want to accept the truth. And that truth is the justice system is only one sided. This riot is like waking up a sleeping giant.
