To be honest the status quo of politics these days is what has killed our country. So someone is willing to challenge the status quo and the potentially highest likelihood of voter fraud in American history! If I were in his shoes I'm not sure I would have said anything different because this system is broken, and has been for decades since lobbyists have begun owning Presidents. The political law is there for a reason, and the law allows for a challenge of the results! The media is completely missing the point and focusing on irreverent maybes. I'm so tired of the media, and Fox should be focusing on the true issues and remember that election laws are there for a reason.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9835,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.9,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":132},{"user_id":1267522033287850,"comment_id":10153863910414087,"date":"2016-06-23","message":"Trump's tax proposals favor the wealthy and he does not want the minimum wage raised.
