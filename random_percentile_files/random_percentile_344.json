Hillary is for late term abortions. She is for open borders and wants millions of immigrants in the USA! Not vetted immigrants means terrorists included! She is for one world order! Taxing middle class! Raise taxes on all! Against our police! George soros (evil man) to run the white house. Because it can be bought with her! Against our army navy airforce marines! Against catholics, against Trump supporters, against Bernie supporters, against blacks calling them super predators, she is not for America Period! And also wants to take our christian beliefs away from us Americans! Wants to take away our constitutional rights! And wants to appoint corrupt people in the supreme court justice! How in the heck can anyone vote for her!
