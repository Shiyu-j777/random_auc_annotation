The problems in the African continent were, in the first instance, created by former European colonialists, who divided and ruled. They now divide and rule by stripping the continent of its precious resources, prop up corrupt African governments, and sell arms to different groups, so that they can all fight and kill each other. It is really pathetic for Africans to accuse Muslims of racism, when many, many Muslims are themselves African and/or brown/coloured. Instead of blaming Muslims, why not make your societies and communities strong, economically, so that Africans do not need to migrate to Europe? And, why not demand an end to all political corruption, which is the cause of great poverty in African countries? You know, it's really lovely to be an internet warrior, far harder to go out into the real world and make a difference for the better. Remember, people, that your expressions of such intense hate are manifestations of extremism - so, you are no better than the ones you condemn. As for you Prashant Sharma - a Hindu, by name - you should be ashamed of yourself. In India, baby girls are routinely aborted, because people want boys - for economic reasons. Rape is rampant and discrimination against females rampant. Stop pretending to a non-existent state of piety and purity - look after the women in your country, and do some good works, instead of spreading hate - because in doing so, you make all Hindus look like arrogant, ignorant fools. (Incidentally, stop believing all the anti-Muslim/Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)/Islam lies, propaganda and disinformation. Use your brains, and go do some study and research about Islam, instead of parrotting what you have read elsewhere. If Muslims want, we too can go dig out some anti-Hindu propaganda with which to bash you. but I will not descend to your level.)","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0019,"user_ideo":-0.4007,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":60},{"comment_id":512963915560855,"date":"2015-03-23","message":"Congress ain't gonna do diddly,they're scared of Obummer.
