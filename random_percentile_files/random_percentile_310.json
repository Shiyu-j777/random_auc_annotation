These same people are oblivious to the fact that Bill Clinton was responsible for repealing the Glass-Steagall legislation in 1998, which separated regular banks and investment banks (i.e., FDIC insured vs Wall Street), which gave Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of the human garbage at Goldman Sachs the green light to gamble with investor's money while taking virtually no risk of their own. It was solely the Democrats who collapsed our economy in 2008, and that's indisputable. And anyone who believes that the immense amount of money Hillary Clinton has taken from these same Wall Street criminals isn't a bribe to allow them to pillage the US economy once again is just stupid beyond belief. Donald Trump has pledged to eliminate the $20 trillion National Debt which Barack Obama doubled during the most failed Presidency in history. With Trump at the helm, our economy will grow in leaps and bounds, and we'll once again be the richest and most powerful nation on earth. There will be nothing we cannot accomplish, once we have a brilliant man in the White House, and the idiots in Washington on a very short leash. by #AnthonyRamirez #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #DonaldTrump","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9991,"user_ideo":0.029,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":310},{"user_id":1185764494811607,"comment_id":10153305554984497,"date":"2015-04-10","message":"It's the Onion....stories are not to be taken seriously.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1135,"user_ideo":-0.4527,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.21,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":310},{"user_id":1742064759407513,"comment_id":1833006743594187,"date":"2016-06-30","message":"There may not be a war in the US, but people are armed and ready.
