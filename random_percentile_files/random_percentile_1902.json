The reason is because these cities are quite expensive to live in. With an increase to the taxpayer base for these cities, it's quite economically beneficial for these cities to add illegal immigrants to the current taxpayer base that they already have. These cities are so progressive, they might a well tax themselves into bankruptcy and I am going to be glad when they're crying for a bailout from the federal government. In response to the question about Trump having the potential in cutting of federal funding for sanctuary cities: Oh yes, Trump is definitely going to cut off federal funding for these cities. The more cuts, the better. It's time for these cities to swallow their own pills when they want higher taxes. Taxing their citizenry is not going to help out much. Thank you for the questions.
