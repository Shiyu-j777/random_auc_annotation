It's almost impossible to disagree with any left wing view without being labeled a hater, a racist, a sexist. In short, I find that leftists find it very hard to appreciate the fact that people with views different to theirs aren't motivated by some kind of hatred. So if you support capitalism, you must \"\"\"\"hate the poor\"\"\"\" even if your argument is that capitalism is the best way to reduce poverty. If you take issue with the left's tendency to see racism in places where it doesn't exist, or to cast minorities as perpetual victims who can't look after their own interests then you must be a racist. If you factually dispute the claim that women are paid less than men for the same job then you must be a sexist, regardless of what evidence you have to back up your argument/. What's really going on here is that when you argue against a left wing article of faith and do it with facts and reason, the response of the left is to try to sabotage the debate by calling you a bigot. They know that all reasoned discussion is thus put on hold until the issue of whether or not you're a bigot has been decided. Thus it becomes almost impossible to disagree with a leftist without the inevitable screeching. And this is what this safety pin nonsense is. You lost an election fair and square and so your response is to claim that you're now living in fear of your lives and thus some kind of emergency support system is needed to protect you from harm.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9813,"user_ideo":0.0405,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":367},{"user_id":1049982761703504,"comment_id":10153307142761770,"date":"2016-02-19","message":"Vote for Trump they can't buy him","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9989,"user_ideo":0.769,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":367},{"user_id":1248075005227066,"comment_id":10152990923731680,"date":"2015-08-13","message":"Yes it can and lots of people do it.
