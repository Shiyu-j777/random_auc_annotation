(And again the news only uses a clip instead of the whole context of the conversation and it goes viral making Trump look bad towards women, conservatives and his stand on abortion.) There are so many groups, orgs. ppl. Establishment , media, super pacs against Trump since he said he was running .I'm surprise he hasn't had a nervous break down by now. ( I would of) I always feel sorry for him in how they treat him and all what he has to deal with on a daily basis). Let me give you one example so you'll understand what hes dealing with daily, George Soros , the evil Nazi liberal billionaire alone has 130 groups against Trump, hammering him every single day in all formats. He's the one who created BLM: black lives matter and move on .org and so many other groups..he pays every single protester as an employee. Okay, now back to my original thought, Trump was asked about abortion and before he would answer or not answer, Chris was drilling him..Trump said hes against abortion and would like to see it brought back to the states to rule on.. then Chris said well if it was ruled \"\"\"\"illegal\"\"\"\", then they both said \"\"\"\"then women would have it done in back alleys\"\"\"\" While Trump was still adding to this thought, Chris again asked another question. Trump was asked if these women would be \"\"\"\"punished\"\"\"\" for having an abortion.Trumps mindset was still on the thought of the women having the procedure done \"\"\"\"illegally\"\"\"\" in a back allies, so he said \"\"\"\"yes, there should be some kind of punishment\"\"\"\". Chris thought he was answering that women who have an abortion should be punished. Trump should of clarified what he was saying but his answer was lost in the fast paced questioning. He clarified later after the interview with an official statement to the press and on twitter..but no matter what, that's all they needed to hear to push more negative press against him. The Illuminati/globalist has an agenda and they worked very hard over the years to get where we are today...and for Trump to come out of no where and lead in the polls for 10 mths and what he stands for, which is against everything the globalist want for the world. That's why they want to get rid of him. So they've been trying everything in the book to bring him down...and so far it hasn't worked. We have to remember, the globalist own both of our parties..and for them it doesn't matter if they place a republican in office or a democrat b/c they own both candidates( through lobbyists, special interest groups and donors that do their bidding) and no matter what, they will do the globalists bidding. (that's why we feel that nothings getting done in Washington or they do the opposite in what we want or the candidates, congress and senate said they would do to get elected.) The reason why the globalist created two parties was b/c; to dup the America ppl in thinking they have a choice...(not realizing its the globalist who raise a candidate, back them, support them and place them into position. Look up agenda 21 or TPTA deal. Trump is taking back our country...it was kidnapped 150 yrs ago..when Abraham Lincoln was murdered..(our government and money) Trump's fighting this great power to give our country back to \"\"\"\"we the people\"\"\"\"...that's why I will stand with Trump no matter what!!! If you love him or hate him...he's the only one who's standing up against this evil power (which is the Beast we know from scripture)","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9992,"user_ideo":0.4849,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.98,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1538},{"user_id":10209768595602559,"comment_id":10153495034681680,"date":"2016-04-22","message":"And he threw it away!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3507,"user_ideo":-0.5755,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.42,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1538},{"user_id":1049469418440187,"comment_id":10153513832401680,"date":"2016-05-02","message":"CAN YOU MAGINE FIORINA VP VISIT TO MIDDLE EAST LIKE JOE BIDEN AND KERRY SHOWING HER FACE...THAT FACE...TO ANY MIDDLE EAST LEADER OR ISIS WITHOUT A BURKA CONCEALING HER FACE.
