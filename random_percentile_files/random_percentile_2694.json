Teacher's are not even regarded as professionals despite having to have to same length of training as an Engineer and Lawyer. And has to go through a similar registration process. Teacher are different from the other caring professions as it requires a much higher level of qualifications or it certainly use to. I was shocked at the level of education of my daughters Teachers in Australia they could't even do basic maths let alone teach it effectively. The level in Germany has been much much higher. But then again here it is seen as a respected profession with high entry level criteria.

A woman, who only cares about women cannot be the president of a country. If the United States was composed of women only, I¡¯m sure she would be a good president. But men, and boys, must be protected from the gyno-centrism of these women who will never be able to lose face by admitting that men and boys are as much predestined to stereotyped roles, and are also limited in their choices by societies. By the way, who is more sexist: Donald Trump, who is closing his eyes on sexism against -both- genders, or Hillary Clinton, who is closing her eyes only- on sexism affecting men and boys? She is being sexist in the way she fights sexism, and this causes injustices and double standards which polarizes the political debate and promotes the conservative right (by rejecting the endorsement of feminist sexism by left parties). Voting for Hillary Clinton is like saying that it¡¯s OK to only protect women from sexism, violence and poverty. Voting for her is like saying that it¡¯s OK to only have empathy and to only show solidarity toward one gender (women). Voting for her is like saying it¡¯s OK to only care about women¡¯s health, in a world where men also suffers from health issues. Voting for her is like saying that it¡¯s OK to only accuse conservative men to be responsible for the division of roles between men and women ( = sexism), and to spare conservative women for their own responsibilities¡¦ which in turns protects women¡¯s privileges. We don¡¯t live in a world where only women and girls are affected by sexism and violence, but we live in a world where only women and girls receive protection from organizations, governments and politicians like her. Men and boys are left to themselves: ¡°to be expendable at wars, men has to be expendable in life in general¡±, and that¡¯s why women like her don¡¯t care or fight for men¡¯s well-being the same way they care and fight for women¡¯s well-being. Often, we see that gender-based violence is targeting men at least as much as women, in everyday life or in war torn countries for example. But also in video games, media, movies and TV series, where it seems there are no limits to our complicit acceptance of violence against men. But despite of all this, she only fights to end¡¦ violence against women and girls, and only them. What about men and boys? Don¡¯t they matter to her too, or does she implicitly thinks that ¡°a man should take it as a man¡±, and accept this sexism against men? A president must fight for, and represent both genders, not just women. Often, we see sexism, double-standards which affect men and boys. But still, Hillary Clinton¡¯s concept of gender equality is¡¦ only consider (and fight) sexism against women and girls, where society is all centered around the ¡°protection of women and children¡±, as if this was not a sexist agenda. As if women, and societies didn¡¯t also have sexist expectations toward men and boys. Despite of all these evidences that society is slowly realizing that it no longer wants to ignore, Hillary Clinton is proud of ¡°fighting for women¡±, and only them, to be the champion of women and girls and to reserve ¡°the best of both worlds¡± to women only. She is completely disconnected from a more modern way of addressing sexism. By her stands, by her writings, she constantly shows that she only sees women as discriminated victims in a world of privileged men, which must be challenged if we want a real gender equality. In order to prove that society, and especially women, care as much for men and boys as they care for women and girls, the race should be about ¡°anyone but Hillary Clinton¡± (¡¦ and ¡°anyone but Trump¡± too, of course). Men and women must all unite to fight against racism, sexism and feminism.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4416,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.49,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":2694},{"comment_id":1741767702630631,"date":"2016-11-30","message":"Get over it yall lost","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9736,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.88,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":2694},{"comment_id":1090780227645338,"date":"2016-03-31","message":"Was this fact checked?
