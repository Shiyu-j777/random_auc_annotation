Too many christians focusing on the love, mercy and grace of Christ and not on the rebuke and truth of Gods word. Rebuking is also in the love of Christ and Christ rebuked and guided a lot! To many christians being led by a wrong way of love. Love is an action and Christ showed us that love by His death and resurrection. During His time on earth Christ did not sin and He rebuked sinners and healed them. He told them about Gid and clearly represented His father in a description of marriage He gave in Matt 19.v3. We can love people but we are not a slave to their way of life just because a law has been brought in by man. God told us to obey His commandments this has now been twisted by man. You can by Law murder babies in the womb does that make it right. Stop asking these christians to be hypocrites because hypocrisy is not love.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9988,"user_ideo":0.6626,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.96,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1364},{"comment_id":10154237112211994,"date":"2017-02-24","message":"Yaaaaasssss","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0094,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1364},{"comment_id":1430910703635340,"date":"2016-08-17","message":"White women wear artificial extensions too FYI.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0409,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.11,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1364},{"user_id":10210928093426830,"comment_id":10153126111912235,"date":"2015-02-26","message":"Baby?

To be honest the status quo of politics these days is what has killed our country. So someone is willing to challenge the status quo and the potentially highest likelihood of voter fraud in American history! If I were in his shoes I'm not sure I would have said anything different because this system is broken, and has been for decades since lobbyists have begun owning Presidents. The political law is there for a reason, and the law allows for a challenge of the results! The media is completely missing the point and focusing on irreverent maybes. I'm so tired of the media, and Fox should be focusing on the true issues and remember that election laws are there for a reason.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9835,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.9,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1364},{"user_id":1444483508915668,"comment_id":10153235019162061,"date":"2015-11-17","message":"'This' country has been bombing long before France and Russia","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2088,"user_ideo":-0.0909,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.3,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1364},{"user_id":1448562955182107,"comment_id":780017322149304,"date":"2017-01-22","message":"This from a person that offer blow jobs for people to vote for Hillary.
