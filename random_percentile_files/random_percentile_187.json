You think openly supporting liberal principles for years is NOTHING? But that aside, the failure of the church is the downfall of the nation. We have lost the heart and soul of America. We have blended with the pagan ideals around us. We have failed to promote the reason for our hope, and we have failed to vote in elections for ethical people who have integrity. We have allowed the non-Christians to set the table and cook the meal. We just get to eat what they have prepared now. Thankfully though, God is still i control of his universe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9974,"user_ideo":0.8774,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.95,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":187},{"comment_id":518088491720015,"date":"2016-06-07","message":"disgusting","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3916,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.45,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":187},{"user_id":1180356581985442,"comment_id":415113228670558,"date":"2015-03-29","message":"Here we go...
