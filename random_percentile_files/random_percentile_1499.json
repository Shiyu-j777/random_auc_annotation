The reason he is not running for Senator again is the people don't want him. He went against the Floridians after he was voted into the Senate. He sold his house for $200K profit and that Lobbyist who purchased the house gets his Legislation pushed by Rubio. Prior to the house sale Rubio was against the Legislation. He is a Repub BO ! BO had that convoluted house deal as well..it's called a kickback. Rubio charged personal items on a Republican Credit Card which he had no legal right to do. Rubio does not understand business at all. Should you ever be involved in Title Searches you would understand that your rich people do have a string of Bankruptcies. Why? They will start a business, and then it fails as 80%+ do...and then they will get right back up and go at it again with another business. We are too chicken to do that. Trump University had 98% Approval and BBB rated A. When people sign up for Real Estate Training they cannot be a lazy bum. They receive the training and sit on the sofa and do nothing thinking the world will come to them. Their modus operandi is then to get their money back. They are perpetual students. We have all met those kind of lazy bums. The Vodka Company is still operating with a profit and that is not bankrupt. The Polish workers some 35 yrs ago were hired by the SubContractor and not Trump. Chances are Rubio does not understand what a Sub Contractor is. Yes, Trump paid a fine, however you can bet the Sub Contractor reimbursed Trump. The laws were different at that time as well. Taxes: Your annual personal taxes, or 1040, etc., will not tell anyone how much you are worth..only an idiot thinks that. the Financial Statement will inform, which Trump filed long ago.The good business person retains as much money as he/she can in the company for reinvestment or for future needs and pays themselves what they need for life (and that particular year year they pay less in taxes as they retain money in business)....my god is Rubio dumb.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.8842,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.98,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":1499}]
