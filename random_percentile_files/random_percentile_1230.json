[{"comment_id":10154492300657439,"date":"2016-06-24","message":"The crusades were ostensibly an effort to \"\"\"\"free\"\"\"\" the holy land. Particularly Jerusalem. In many cases, as in the siege/ sack of Constantinople in 1204, it turned into a land grab. The crusades did manage to stop the expansion of Islam. Why is any of this pertinent? Because the seeds of this ongoing war between Islam and Christianity date back beyond that time. Those who do not learn from History are doomed to repeat it. Read Iron Men or The Flame of Islam, by Harold Lamb. Both are interesting studies of that pivotal time period. As a side bar: if I'm not mistaken military leaders around the world and in The U.S. in particular study historical conflicts and battles to gain understanding of strategies and tactics, and errors of various enemies/combatants.
