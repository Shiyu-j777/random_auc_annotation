Choose not your fathers nor your brethren for friends if they take pleasure in disbelief rather than faith. Whoso of you taketh them for friends, such are wrong-doers. 58:14 Hast thou not seen those who take for friends a folk with whom Allah is wroth ? They are neither of you nor of them, and they swear a false oath knowingly. (58:14-15) Don't make friends with Allah's enemies. For those who do so, Allah has prepared a dreadful doom. And if you say that you don't take those verses seriously, you're condemned again: 34:5 But those who strive against Our revelations, challenging (Us), theirs will be a painful doom of wrath. And don't try to claim that the Qur'an doesn't command Muslims to kill the infidel: 39:60 And on the Day of Resurrection thou (Muhammad) seest those who lied concerning Allah with their faces blackened. Is not the home of the scorners in hell ? Because if you lie about it then again you're condemned. Because we all know it clearly tells Muslims to fight against and kill non believers: 47:4 Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.

Most certainly we can say that Trump¡¯s supporters erroneously think he is Jeff Sessions on immigration and a conservative on some other issues, but even most of Rubio¡¯s supporters have no idea how committed their candidate is to open borders. Rubio gets up at every debate and feigns outrage over the border and completely lies about his past. He has even said that his amnesty bill was never designed to pass. Anyone who fought this issue at the time remembers that Rubio promoted this bill with a presidential campaign-style media battle. The notion that he didn¡¯t fight for open borders is as false as the notion that Rubio was responsible for getting rid of the ¡°risk corridors¡± bailout in Obamacare. Now the New York Times is reporting that Rubio and Schumer collaborated with Fox News to lie to conservatives about the immigration bill in a full-throttle effort to get the bill passed: A few weeks after Senator Marco Rubio joined a bipartisan push for an immigration overhaul in 2013, he arrived alongside Senator Chuck Schumer at the executive dining room of News Corporation¡¯s Manhattan headquarters for dinner. Their mission was to persuade Rupert Murdoch, the owner of the media empire, and Roger Ailes, the chairman and chief executive of its Fox News division, to keep the network¡¯s on-air personalities from savaging the legislation and give it a fighting chance at survival. Mr. Murdoch, an advocate of immigration reform, and Mr. Ailes, his top lieutenant and the most powerful man in conservative television, agreed at the Jan. 17, 2013, meeting to give the senators some breathing room. Rubio left no stone unturned in trying to champion Obama¡¯s immigration agenda and register 20 million new Democratic voters at a time when Obama was inviting the newest border crisis. Unfortunately, the one man who actually fought amnesty is now sandwiched between two con men that refuse to follow the honorable example of Jeb Bush and run on the veracity of their true convictions. Let¡¯s remember, no candidate will ever run in a primary openly supporting amnesty, lest they suffer the fate of Jeb Bush. Well, who better than the owner of Fox News himself to reveal to us who he trusts to implement their agenda, the agenda revealed in the New York Times article. It comes as no surprise that Murdoch would cheer on Rubio and Kasich. But notice how he added Trump to the list of those he deems acceptable in a general election. Guess who was left off that list? The one man the entire establishment hates and views as an existential threat to their existence: Ted Cruz. It¡¯s up to conservatives to be discerning as to which candidate will actually remain faithful to the conservative message the day after the primaries are over. Anyone who is tired of the political establishment and its puppet masters should look carefully at the actions of Fox leadership; it won¡¯t be too hard to ascertain whom they really fear. Pro tip: If the people we are fighting don¡¯t really fear your candidate, they probably have good reason.
