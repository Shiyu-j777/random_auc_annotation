Osama bin laden, Molla Omor and ISIS wont be able to match the number combined in a hundred year. Apply for the names of US soilders who were ever deployed in the destructiontion of iraq afganistan libiya or any number of countries, u will get your names of american terrorists. I am sure there are many nice and righteous peoples in USA, i know some of them, but that does not change the fact that the US republic has been engaged in mass killing, looting and murder of millions of peoples since its founding and is the grearest terrorist state of the world at the moment.

Not likely. Also, there are many factors at play when determining your speed. I'm only talking about the theoretical maximum for the line itself. And yes modulation scheme is one of those factors. Keep in mind that Internet traffic isn't the only thing being carried by the coax lines. TV transmission talked up a lot of the bandwidth for coax lines. Yes, the signals are segregated but in an overall sense, if half of the bandwidth of a coax line is dedicated to tv, then you've already dropped that 3-4 Gbps down to 1.5-2 Gbps. Factor in users on a segment, the aging condition of the majority of the lines in place and you aren't going to get that 1Gbps speed. And exactly how would you \"\"\"\"halve the distance\"\"\"\"? Unless you are looking at moving into a place that is right next to the provider node, your TX distance isn't something that you have control over. And if you are looking at doubling the modulation scheme, you'd better have that TX power problem solved, otherwise, you aren't going to get your improved signal to the home at the power levels needed to provide the increased speed. At any rate, the solutions you stated might work but it's going to take a hell of a lot more than just replacing a modem to make it work.

They can't concentrate, it's not their fault...society doesn't see them, but teachers do. By the time they get to college age, they don't have all the fundamentals, even though they have desire.
