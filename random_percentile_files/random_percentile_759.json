Our nation is in such distress and unrest and king trump has stirred a hornets nest of racism, fascism, antisemitism, gender discrimination, hatred towards non-Christians, hatred towards immigrants and refugees, bullying and sick, elderly and disabled. Our Nation is ALREADY Great! Why because we the people have formed a more perfect union of huddled masses seeking freedom, equality and grace in a land of the free and home of the brave comprised of both the majority and minority PEOPLE. People are unique and most have many challenges throughout life. We need each other and have a common aim to do unto others as we would have done to us. That Golden rule and the idea that we have a responsibility for ourselves and the least amoung us. The safety net and aid for those in our midst and abroad have created the more perfect union that does shine as a light set on a hillside. We, USA, cannot shirk it's mission and purpose in history to continue to move further upon the road of this perfection and NOT hide the light under the bushel! We have delayed in the past to aid or open our doors to those who knocked under extreme duress (Japanese Americans, Native Americans, Jews in WWII, Bosnians, Hispanics fleeing, Palestinians, Croatians, etc) now we see the fleeing from terror. We cry with the Syrian refugees and those disrupted by war. Instead of spending energy on rejecting them can we not spend our mutual energy on better solutions. When we reject our own immigrants and seek to deport them, we must pay to detain and IMPRISON them for three years, rip away their children from their arms, place these children in foster care or another type of jail, steal their possessions and property! Why are we destroying our future? Is this about GREED like that which possessed the Nazis in WWII to steal the riches (including gold teeth, skin, eye glasses, shoes, clothes, etc) of their victims? Why are we not more creative? We are a nation of innovative and creative people from the great mixing bowl of humans who make this land their own. Think clearly and unlock the gridlock in Congress with a new endeavor for Unity, Tranquility for our grand experiment of INCLUSION not EXCLUSION. Your endeavor to unify Congress across all party lined against all enemies both DOMESTIC and FOREIGN will move our nation further along this journey! Shall we go backward! NO. NO! NO! A resounding NO! We are a land of generous souls from the least to the greatest amoung us. Stop the greed and the consolidation of wealth in the top 1% while the rest are falling backwards. Stop isolating us from each other and the rest of the world. Wake up from your slumber. Lead us out of this morass by joining hands across the party lines. Stop the chaos. Distress is extreme as we watch the richest become richer without caring for those who are reaching up towards them. They turn their nose up and their eyes away as they gaze with love in the eyes of the other rich. They are gluttyons, steal through smiles of corruption, eat cake while the masses are starving! You cannot serve G-d and Mammon. The good Samaritan crossed over the road toward the wounded foreigner while the rich and religious purposefully crossed over to the other side of the road to AVOID aiding their fellow human in distress. Which one will you be? Time to act, time to set a new course! We the People will continue to peacefully protest and take actions to ensure you hear our voices loud and clear. We call on you now! Change course, uphold protect and defend our Constitution and the rule of law! Very respectfully, OUR EYES ARE WIDE OPEN!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":759},{"comment_id":911253282329244,"date":"2016-03-03","message":"Lollll","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1636,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.26,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":759},{"user_id":843536879081388,"comment_id":1188140301205998,"date":"2015-09-04","message":"Meet the Fully Organized Corporate Press with your Fox News host Chuck Todd on NBC.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0069,"user_ideo":-0.6442,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":759},{"comment_id":10153305898661336,"date":"2015-05-28","message":"Tennessee Volunteers for Heroes is hosting a benefit to help the Wounded Warrior Project.
