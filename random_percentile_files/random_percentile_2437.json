You already make two or three times what non-union workers make, even though you lazy jerks don't work nearly as hard. But that's somehow never enough for you. And you have the nerve to call other people greedy! As a truck driver, i absolutely despise when i have to go to a union warehouse or factory. They are ALWAYS incredibly rude and extremely slow. It's very common for me to spend an entire day there, because they take their own sweet time. No sense in working hard when you're guaranteed a ridiculously high wage regardless of how hard you work.

You can check them out on the state and local level to see if their views and policies are similar to yours. If you are looking for change this is the level to start making politicans work for you. A few years ago we had politicians who thought they were above the people. Well the people had a recall election and throw the bums out. Since that recall the politicans work for the town,not themselves or their party affiliation. People have power for change they just need to work together and let politicians know who their boss happens to be, and that's the voters.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1052,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.2,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":2437},{"user_id":10155164011495550,"comment_id":10154365860926162,"date":"2016-05-29","message":"Paul Anthony watch the video with ut","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3,"user_ideo":-0.2816,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.38,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":2437},{"user_id":1772240423047376,"comment_id":10153290678063984,"date":"2015-04-10","message":"Take the money away.
