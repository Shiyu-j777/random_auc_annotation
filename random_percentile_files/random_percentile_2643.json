TED AND HEIDI CRUZ !!!!!SHARE THIS EVERY WHERE !!! TED CRUZ IS THE PREACHER that said( he thinks gays should be killed ) there is a video with Cruz saying this on you tube AND HIS CULT CHURCH agreed with him . !!!!! CRUZ FOLLOWERS are Tricked by his BIG LIES !!!! TRUMP IS A CONSERVATIVE !!!!THE LIBERAL IS CRUZ !!!! HIS FATHER IS CUBAN !!!! HE IS HILLARY IN A MANS BODY !!! HILLARY CLINTON ALSO RECEIVED MONEY FROM GOLDMAN SACKS !!!!, You MUST know these things! Educate yourselves on him and his wife * Heidi Cruz has been employed by Goldman Sachs since 2005. She is currently on leave. * Heidi Cruz is a member of the leftist council on foreign relations, advocates of world Government and a New World Order. * Ted Cruz was George Bush's top policy advisor. * Ted Cruz was in the federal Trade Commission. * Ted and Heidi met when they were both Bush staffers.( BIG LIE ) TEDDY WHOSE REAL NAME IS RAPHAEL and HEIDI ARE BLOOD COUSINS. * Cruz advised on legal affairs and Heidi on economic policy for the bush administration. * Heidi was director for the Western Hemisphere on the national security council under Condoleeza Rice. * Heidi served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative to USTR head, Robert Zoellick, working on China trade policy. * Ted Cruz' campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, is a former CIA officer. He also worked for Goldman Sachs. * Ted Cruz voted for cloture on TPA, (trans pacific partnership agreement) fast track trade authority, removing the hurdle of concern for further amendment, and clearing the way for passage! It didn't have to be recorded, so nobody knew this. He voted NOT to require approval of congress before other countries could join, including China. * Cruz has openly stated that he will NOT use a deportation force, and will continue to use the failed ICE system, where an illegal has to commit a crime first, then be caught. * Cruz belongs to the radical Christian sect of 7 mountains dominionism, that seeks to place their members in control of our culture and create a NWO though the domination of business, government, media, arts & entertainment, education, family, and religion. He is the appointed messiah/savior of their group. * Ted Cruz has only been a citizen for about 19 months! He renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014 so he could run for president. There are also other reasons that he is not constitutionally eligible, including the fact that both of his parents were NOT U.S. Citizens when he was born, only his mother was. Wise up, he's not who you think he is he has always been establishment, he is bought and paid by the banks. He did not vote to audit the Federal Reserve, he most certainly is establishment.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":2643},{"comment_id":842388285895946,"date":"2016-05-31","message":"The only way to eradicate skin bleaching is to promote black beauty instead of hiding the facts that dark skin is one of the most beautiful and gifted thing in the world.... #MelaninBaby","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0069,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":2643},{"user_id":10202053820462701,"comment_id":10153857190663690,"date":"2015-11-16","message":"This is the face of Islam! If you take the time to read, you will find Islam in every country in the world today. Islam is migrating and believe it or not, the migration of Islam is on purpose. Muslims are staging a global Jihad with the intent of forcing Islam into every nation on the globe. It begins with a small migration of people who seem interested in peacefully assimilating into the host country. Then, when enough Muslims have entered a country they split. Some seek political office to try and claim power to push Islamic law before the laws of the land and to separate their people to gain private domain settlements within a country Others seek to disrupt the peace and economy by terrorizing and disrupting a country. The goal of Islam is clearly stated in the Qur'an. According to the Holy Book of Islam, Islam is the ONLY religion and every person on Earth must become Muslim or die. Islam cannot peacefully co-exist with any other religion because to do so would be to fail Islam Law and any Muslim who fails Islamic Law is cast out and becomes as the non-believer. The inevitable is going to happen. When enough Muslims enter a country to be a viable force, their intent is to take the land by force and kill everyone who opposes them. ISIS is an example of Islam in action. You can deny the inevitable as long as you want but sooner or later every person in the free world will have to face Islam in a war to save themselves from being forced into Islam. It's your choice, deny the facts and sit idle while you lose your country or look whats happening all over the world and demand that our government take a stand against the migration of Islam. We can do it now while Islam is controllable or we can fight Islam in our own streets. It's your choice.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9989,"user_ideo":-0.2601,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":2643},{"comment_id":1125013190880560,"date":"2016-09-23","message":"She was mentally challenged....I guess....he feared for his life so he defended himself with his willy.....perfect!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1023,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.19,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":2643},{"user_id":10154239025800469,"comment_id":10153235371311491,"date":"2015-10-01","message":"x","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0436,"user_ideo":-0.4326,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.12,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":2643},{"comment_id":1027502884043067,"date":"2016-11-15","message":"a yucky, negative energy","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2647,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.35,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":2643},{"user_id":481754088836709,"comment_id":10154470435919586,"date":"2016-08-19","message":"people disgust me.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1212,"user_ideo":-0.6513,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.21,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":2643},{"comment_id":10155149572566037,"date":"2017-01-23","message":"I don't know why you people even bother responding to a profile clearly made just to project what this person is to much of a coward to put on their real profile.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3619,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.43,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":2643},{"user_id":310624929271931,"comment_id":1240756085959810,"date":"2016-10-27","message":"Go President Trump!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.8263,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":2643},{"user_id":10207283521110131,"comment_id":10153031924831336,"date":"2015-03-04","message":"I hope this person is not special needs.
