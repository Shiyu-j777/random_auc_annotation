This could be serious...we need to vote trump. Please share! And Hillary's a traitor. Check this out... This could explain the bogus investigation by the FBI and Director Comey's recommendation for no indictment to the A.G. Consider this: I just read this post someone else posted.....scary, but it makes sense ..If Hillary Clinton will wins the election in November. Sometime between November and January, Hillary will be indicted. The IRS is now investigating the Clinton Foundation and the whole e-mail thing isn't over yet. Once under indictment she won't be able to assume the Office of the President in January. Tim Kaine, who will not actually be the Vice President because neither he nor Hillary have been inaugurated, cannot assume the Presidency.\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"The Speaker of the House can't move up to it because there is already a sitting President and Vice President. So President Obama, in an Executive Order citing \"\"\"\"emergency situation,\"\"\"\" gives himself another four years in office is the only way possible.\"\"\"\" I believe Obama has been planning this for a while now, knowing he has enough on Hillary to indict her. Had the Attorney General indicted her based on evidence from the FBI this plan wouldn't have worked because the DNC would have quickly come up with another candidate If you think about it, it's not that outrageous. Many people on the left, including the President, want Obama to stay another four years. The law prohibits him from being re-elected so the only way he can do it is by declaring martial law and suspending the election (which would be a very negative thing for the country) or to declare himself still President because the elected candidate cannot assume her duties. The latter makes more sense and is actually more feasible. And since it's never been done before, it would set a precedent that would be difficult to challenge. Of course, if Trump wins the election none of this is going to happen. But what if this is correct? Four more years of Obama and a mostly useless Republican House and Senate would give Obama the time he needs to continue destroying changing the country to fit his stated goals. Copy and paste if you like...everyone needs to see this ----- NOTE: We have the opportunity and power to stop this. This is why they are bludgeoning Trump. They are scared.

Instead of taking an essentialist approach, which lays emphasis on essences, we need to look at the evolution of social phenomena in its proper historical context. For instance: to assert that human beings are evil by nature is an essentialist approach; it overlooks the role played by nurture in grooming human beings. Human beings are only intelligent by nature, but they are neither good nor evil by nature; whatever they are, whether good or evil, is the outcome of their nurture or upbringing. Islam is regarded as the fastest growing religion of the 20th and 21st centuries. There are two factors responsible for this atavistic phenomena of Islamic resurgence: firstly, unlike Christianity which is more idealistic, Islam is a more practical religion, it does not demand from its followers to give up worldly pleasures but only insists on regulating them; and secondly, Islam as a religion and ideology has the world¡¯s richest financiers. Muslims are not perfect but Islam is. Islam is a pure and a peaceful religion. Do not listen to what media has to say about Islam but find out for yourself. Educate yourself enough to speak about the religion. Quran is proved to be in its pure words that was given to prophet Muhammad (PBUH) ..and this is proved by many non Muslim scholars and Muslim scholars alike ¡¦ And all the religious scholars accept that Quran is having no contradictory words. besides Islam ,all the religious scholars accept that their books have changed by passage of time but Islam is in its pure form .. Islam never teaches us to insult any other religions no matter what the non-Muslim says about yours¡¦ That¡¯s the teaching of prophet Muhammad (PBUH). We love Adam Noah ¡¦mosses Jesus.. Muhammad peace be upon them all ¡¦. why would highly educated people around the world accept Islam or embrace Islam ??? Even after all the media have portrayed Islam in negative way or misrepresented Islam always in a worst manner ??? Why would a country where you could find highest number of churches in the world turn into highest numbers of mosques ???? According to Islam ,when Jesus comes back Muslims and Christians both will follow him and also some Jews will ¡¦ And about the media , they are not protecting Islam ,they are trying to spread hatred of Islam all over the world so that no more people accepts Islam but unfortunately to the ones who hate Islam , after every time they try to spread hatred about Islam more and more people accepts Islam ¡¦ when WTC were attacked and brought down and given a name that Muslims did this but obviously today everyone knows who did it¡¦ After that attack millions around the world got the message of Islam and millions accepted Islam ¡¦example ..only in France more than 50000 people accepted Islam within few days after the attack ¡¦ what about the ones with high knowledge about Christianity and fighting against Islam but eventually you see them accepting ISLAM .. why??? Are they not ¡°shown¡± with both side arguments ???? Why would Islam be the fastest growing religion and not any other religion ??? Our beloved prophet Muhammad promised us that ISLAM will spread all over the world ..and it¡¯s happening now ¡¦how did he know ???? George Bernard Shaw The Genuine Islam Vol.No.8, 1936. ¡°I believe if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring much needed peace and happiness. I have studied him the man and in my opinion is far from being an anti Christ. He must be called the Saviour of Humanity. I have prophesied about the faith of Mohammad that it would be acceptable the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today.¡± Islam is the fastest growing religion and will continue to grow until it enters every house on earth, this is not my saying, it is the saying of the prophet Muhammad Revealed to him by God. This is Gods plan and Gods work, nothing man can do about.We, the Muslims believe in the Oneness of Allah (God) in all aspects. What is meant is that there is a clear difference between the Creator and the creation, and that there is nothing whatsoever that can be compared to the Creator. We believe that Allah (God) is the Lord of everything, and there is no lord besides Him. We believe that He (alone) created the Heavens and the Earth and everything that is found in them (whether seen or unseen), without the help of anyone or anything. We believe that He is the Sole Possessor, Creator, Provider, Sustainer, and Maintainer of everything. He is the One who brings life into existence and the One who causes death. He is not in need of, nor does He depend upon anything, but everyone and everything depends upon Him. We believe that He created humanity for one purpose; to worship Him alone, and that He has placed everything in the Earth as an aid for mankind to achieve this goal. Worship to Allah should be the number one focus in everyone¡¯s life and everything else besides that is secondary. We believe that all acts of worship are due to Allah alone; from supplication, fear, hope, dependency, prayer, fasting, obedience, submission, seeking help, repentance, vowing, sacrificing, and other than that from the various acts of worship. We believe that if anyone does any act of worship for other than Allah (God) then they have committed the worse sin in creation. We believe in accountability, which means that every single human being will be judged for their actions. Thus everyone who obeys Allah and worships Him alone will receive His Mercy and Forgiveness. Likewise everyone who disobeys Him and worships other than Him will receive His Wrath and Punishment. No man will be responsible for the deeds of another. The father will not be judged for the sins of the son, nor vice versa. No man can die for another man¡¯s sins, on the contrary every individual will be held accountable for what his own hands put forth. We believe that all the Prophets and Messengers from Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Jonah, Lot, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, John, Jesus the son of Mary, and Muhammad (the last Prophet and Messenger) came with this invitation. The Prophets called the people to submission and wilful compliance to Allah, and this is the religion of Islam in which we the Muslims invite humanity. Bernard Shaw who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1925, said, ¡°I have always held the religion of Muhammad in highest esteem because of its wonderful vitality. It is the only religion which appears to me to possess that assimilating capability to the changing phases of existence which can make it appeal to every age. I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad, that it would be acceptable to the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today.¡±[15] Is it a miracle or not?
