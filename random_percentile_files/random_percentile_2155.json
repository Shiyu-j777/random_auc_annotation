What a bunch of ignorant propaganda. Carson has absolutely no relationship with Louis Farrakhan, and his only association with Sharpton was as a guest speaker at ONE event that was hosted by Sharpton. .At that event, Carson said; \"\"\"\"Sharpton and I have the same goal: to build a brighter, stronger America that provides equal opportunities and access to the underserved and forgotten. However, we have a fundamental difference of opinion regarding the best way to achieve such an end.\"\"\"\" So they have a common belief. To assume that they are in alliance because of that statement would be like me assuming that because you, and Charles Manson both want freedom, that you are in alliance with Charles Manson. Dr. Ben Carson has no alliance with Sharpton at all! This is a smear campaign by liberals and Trump Trolls. Dr. Carson addressed this issue on his Facebook page a couple weeks ago in response to an email: \"\"\"\" I would guess that the origin of this smear is the fact that I did agree to speak to the National Action Network in New York in April. Several people told me they would throw me out of the room if I went up there to speak. I did speak because they needed to hear the truth. Reverend Sharpton introduced me by telling the audience he didn¡¯t agree with me on anything. The room was cold at first, but by the end of my speech on self reliance and the family unit, I finished to a standing ovation. The speech was posted on Facebook right after. I went up to defend conservative principles and to tell African Americans there is a better way. If you'd like to, please watch the speech in my videos section. I can¡¯t possibly imagine having the free time to ¡°troll.\"\"\"\" But my politics and Reverend Sharpton¡¯s have nothing in common. Thanks for asking the question, Matt.\"\"\"\" - Dr. Ben Carson Carson also said: \"\"\"\"I keep seeing some ¡°trolls¡± spreading a rumor that Al Sharpton and I are somehow fast friends. This all goes back to a speech I gave at the National Action Network months ago. You can watch the speech here on my Facebook page. The National Action Network is a left wing organization full of ¡°community organizers.\"\"\"\" When they invited me to come, I immediately said yes. I thought it was time they heard the truth. I am not afraid to speak to hostile audiences. This one was very different. I gave a speech about personal responsibility and how the government¡¯s anti-poverty programs failed. I challenged inner-city schools about failing to teach our children. I was pretty tough on the left. But, as I continued to speak I noticed more and more heads starting to nod in agreement. At the end of the speech, they gave me a standing ovation. Bottom line, Al Sharpton and I couldn¡¯t be more apart on political issues.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9944,"user_ideo":0.0938,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":2155},{"user_id":10154458865066350,"comment_id":10154002297681130,"date":"2016-06-22","message":"\"\"\"\"poor little things\"\"\"\"? wow.
