Whether or not the roads are sold, there is people having jobs. Same thing goes for a lot of companies that have sold their business to others overseas. They still have jobs, which is important especially after the oil bust. They're not stealing from me. They offer a highway with less traffic for a price. I pay for it because I don't want to be stuck in traffic, so it works out. I spend around $21 a day on tolls, and wouldn't have it another way. If you choose (magic word) not to spend money on tolls, then don't. They benefit people like myself that don't want to spend the extra time on more traffic-filled roads. I understand everyone's views, but I disagree that they should be free. Especially when it's helping people put food on the table for many families. Besides, I don't want to imagine every highway looking like 290.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1349,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.23,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":2208},{"user_id":10153775110736778,"comment_id":1221185851263799,"date":"2017-01-22","message":"your mom seems kewl.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0471,"user_ideo":-0.6181,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.12,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":2208},{"user_id":1476100642416502,"comment_id":10152901214926051,"date":"2015-03-31","message":"Expose the bully","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1194,"user_ideo":0.8073,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.21,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":2208},{"user_id":10209085225621151,"comment_id":1317146191675856,"date":"2016-10-30","message":"You're a man, so of course you'd say that.
