But I came away from the atheist doctrine 2 years ago after a very personal encounter. Few ponders for you - the world says we 'evolved' and it's 'proven' but yet still have no idea where the morals come from... Crocodile's have apparently been on the earth for 200 million years and apparently Humans have existed 200,000 years... Weird how crocs still haven't evolved or at least gained even one moral yet. How come humans have suddenly gained morals above every animal? The atheist deity is based on nothing (beautiful irony) as apparently everything came to be from nothing. Perhaps check out the debates of Professor John Lennox from Oxford University, who's a Christian Apologist who debates with famous atheists. But God is loving but He is holy and just. If a judge let a guilty man walk free, would he be just? Would a person allow someone into their house who they don't know? There is Satan and co who's aim is to deceive the world by lies to keep you away from the truth of God or twist the view of God. Don't be deceived. God doesn't let any guilty man walk free, guilty verdict has punishment. BUT Jesus offers to take that guilty verdict upon Himself, He died by taking your/mine/the world's punishment and death and raised up from being dead, never being under the curse of death ever again. Choose Him, seek Him, He will lead you into truth. John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.996,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.94,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1237},{"comment_id":1325751757491576,"date":"2017-02-09","message":"thats coo but i gotta Hispanic femaleðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚im good","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0984,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.19,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1237},{"user_id":10102862928769867,"comment_id":10154385839502939,"date":"2017-02-16","message":"Adriana Gambardella Parascandolo I too came here when I was 5, yet I sympathize because I remember the hardships that my parents had to go through. It's sad that you have put yourself on a pedestal and believe yourself to be above others who are simply trying to live a better life. Most of these people come from countries that subject them to terrible conditions. I have nothing against deporting criminals who committed violent crimes, but the lack of empathy toward other human beings whose only crime was to cross a border (whether crossing the actual border or overstaying their time through a visa) is what is truly troubling. Illegal immigrants and permanent residents are all afraid. To be clear, the vetting process and pathway to citizenship was much simpler back in the day.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.004,"user_ideo":-0.0713,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1237},{"comment_id":10154666177433690,"date":"2016-09-16","message":"Peace is possible if 1. israel get out of occupied territories 2.end apartheid and learn to live with other races, culture and religion in the country..israel came from europe and established itself in a volatile region.never came with peace, came with war and that didn't go away it is flowing in their blood and passing it to the next generation.
