Therefore, fellow countrymen are preferred to foreigners and relatives to strangers, for with them Nature herself engenders friendship, but it is one that is lacking in constancy. For friendship excels relationship in this, that goodwill maybe eliminated from relationship while from friendship it cannot; since, if you remove goodwill from friendship the very name of friendship is gone; if you remove it from relationship, the name of relationship still remains. Moreover, how great the power of friendship is may most clearly be recognized from the fact that, in comparison with the infinite ties uniting the human race and fashioned by Nature herself, this thing called friendship has been so narrowed that the bonds of affection always united two persons only, or, at most, a few. ~Cicero, De Amicitia","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1345,"user_ideo":-0.539,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.23,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1996},{"comment_id":1441678242555983,"date":"2017-02-19","message":"Op Eds rarely came out the same day the news hit.
