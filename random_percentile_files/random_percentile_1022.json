If you plan to vote for Ted Cruz, you MUST know these things!

She is currently on leave. * Heidi Cruz is a member of the leftist council on foreign relations, advocates of world Government and a New World Order. * Ted Cruz was George Bush's top policy advisor. * Ted Cruz was in the federal Trade Commission. * Ted and Heidi met when they were both Bush staffers. * Cruz advised on legal affairs and Heidi on economic policy for the bush administration. * Heidi was director for the Western Hemisphere on the national security council under Condoleeza Rice. * Heidi served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative to USTR head, Robert Zoellick, working on China trade policy. * Ted Cruz' campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, is a former CIA officer. He also worked for Goldman Sachs. * Ted Cruz voted for cloture on TPA, (trans pacific partnership agreement) fast track trade authority, removing the hurdle of concern for further amendment, and clearing the way for passage!

He voted NOT to require approval of congress before other countries could join, including China. * Cruz has openly stated that he will NOT use a deportation force, and will continue to use the failed ICE system, where an illegal has to commit a crime first, then be caught. * Cruz belongs to the radical Christian sect of 7 mountains dominionism. Heidi, also was arrested in TX, she was wondering around on a busy main Hwy. in the middle of the night. Police took her to jail and then to a crazy hospital stating she was a danger to others and herself.

OK. First of all you say that she will give tax relief to small businesses when you admit she has not released her plan. BTW let's not forget the Tax Policy Center is a liberal organization. As for her constituents they do support increasing taxes for small business, Take Kansas for example, our Governor gave a tax break, Democrats want them to pay taxes no relief. So I highly doubt she will give tax relief to small businesses. Second, you use the EPA statement as evidence saying that consumer bills will reduce. Sorry but it's an EPA plan and that doesnt suffice as independent. Third he said lose full time jobs that could mean as you said reduction of hours because they are no longer full time jobs. Fourth, actually Hillary did say she would raise taxes on the middle class. Let's use snopes, the liberal's favorite fact checker, !.
