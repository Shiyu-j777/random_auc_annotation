Those cases, which together used $258,000 from Trump’s charity, were among four newly documented expenditures in which Trump may have violated laws against “self-dealing” — which prohibit nonprofit leaders from using charity money to benefit themselves or their businesses. In one case, from 2007, Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club faced $120,000 in unpaid fines from the town of Palm Beach, Fla., resulting from a dispute over the size of a flagpole. In a settlement, Palm Beach agreed to waive those fines — if Trump’s club made a $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. Instead, Trump sent a check from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity funded almost entirely by other people’s money, according to tax records. In another case, court papers say one of Trump’s golf courses in New York agreed to settle a lawsuit by making a donation to the plaintiff’s chosen charity. A $158,000 donation was made by the Trump Foundation, according to tax records. According to the report, Trump used Trump Foundation money, that would be money that was donated by other people to his charitable foundation to do charitable stuff, to pay for debts owed by Trump's personal businesses. This, however, is in keeping with Trump using Trump Foundation money for a political donation to Florida's Attorney General and to buy a portrait of him for his personal use. These all are covered by the IRS regulations prohibiting \"\"\"\"self-dealing\"\"\"\" by charitable organizations. TRUMP SPENT $8.2 Million to Family Businesses. Money collected from his donors.

My initial impression of Trudeau was when I caught his \"\"\"\"Because it's 2015,\"\"\"\" comments on my normal weekly news recaps. Personally, I'm a firm believer in equal opportunity and equal representation. But forced equal outcome is NOT an ideal solution to anything. There's less women in politics (not because of a lack of opportunity but for a lack of willingness) so, statistically, if you are pulling 50% of a cabinet from a much smaller pool of talent then you are likely passing up better qualified candidates in the other, larger pool of talent. That's literally discrimination and preferential hiring and it's extremely regressive under the guise of progressivism. The next step is to restrict the larger pool's numbers so that it forces less spots to be filled...that's not equal opportunity. I do believe that Trudeau is a highly intelligent person who is qualified to lead. But the rest of the world views him as Tumblr: The Prime Minister in the same way the rest of the world views Trump as Ridiculous Incarnate. At some point, the leader must wade through the bullshit from both sides, objectively see the facts, and make his own decisions. Trudeau, from an outsider's perspective, seems to just be going with pop pseudo science and it's sort of making you guys lose your reputation of being the most friendly and awesome people in the world. Take my input however you'd like...but this is the impression he's giving on the World Stage.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0027,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":1294},{"user_id":1160926453978807,"comment_id":10153208828979170,"date":"2015-03-18","message":"Congrats! to Netanyahu!!!!!!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9881,"user_ideo":0.795,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.91,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1294},{"user_id":1059399964095430,"comment_id":10153093721001051,"date":"2015-06-18","message":"so they are going to wear the burka into the water ??????????
