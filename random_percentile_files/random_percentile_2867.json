Instead you sit their in the Hillary Clinton Bandwagon and think, he's nothing compared to her. After failed attempts from the democrats and republicans in office, we need a candidate that is different. A candidate who wants more than to wake up and go through the ins and outs of the presidency and then go to sleep at night. We need a candidate who wants change, who strives for it. After watching a lot of Hillary Clinton I conclude that shes a textbook politician. The same old. Listen with an open ear to some of the republicans. You might be surprised when you find out that we're not all the same.
