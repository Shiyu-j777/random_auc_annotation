It is very likely, that those voters who are not yet decided between Trump and Clinton (and believe in the 1st Amendment), are now decided.

You need a social security and be a legal alien. 3.- That ID is not a driver license. As much as we all know that is not okay for anyone to come to this country illegally. That won't stop. But let's open our minds a little. When someone is here illegally and do something wrong, weather is a crime, or get pulled over for driving without an DL. All they have to do is move from whatever address o number they gave the officer involved, and there's no way or knowing where they are. But if when they get that ID, which is similar to an employment or school ID. They will know who they are and with technology so advanced they can be tracked within them selfs or family. Knowing who is here by giving them an ID and if there was to be a massive deportation. They would know where to find them. (Hopefully that won't happen for the children's wellbeing). But regardless of any ideas or beliefs we have. It's important to know who is here, even if they are here illegally. I really believe that most Americans, including myself, are not racists.
