A true leader does not sell anything. He or she merely brings knowledge to the people, full disclosure, leads by example and the people make a choice, better or worse off than what they are used to... As far as Anonymous goes, I think they are doing a fine job in exposing the agendas and educating the people. In my personal opinion, many would take better notice and take them more seriously if they had a name and face to relate to. They are being cautious with their identity for their own safety. I believe some of their tactics results in scaring people from being associated with them but what they do takes courage and at the end of the day, it gets people talking which is the starting point in this struggle... by the way, the word jihad means to struggle, not to bomb, kill or terrorize as the governments and media have changed the meaning to suit their fear mongering and islamophobia agenda... it means to struggle.. simple as that... one can struggle in school, at work, in sports, in traffic... whatever your personal struggle is, its your personal jihad... so my point is, educating ourselves so we can deprogram our minds of the brainwashing damage the governments have done upon us we have a fighting chance to make a difference... My belief is simple, virtually the same beliefs as a muslim that christians and jews and any other religion have... peace, justice, liberty, truth for all, everyone is equal, whether one is poor or rich and its our responsibility to be the voice of the voiceless, be the fighters for the oppressed and occupied, sharing the wealth and resources... this isn't some socialist idea, its something thats been said in every religious book since the begining of time, quran, torah, bible, etc... all say its our responsibility to care for and feed one another, we are the entrusted custodians of the earth and all its inhabitants, animals, plants, water, humans","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0044,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":488},{"user_id":10212156731940449,"comment_id":836418453117877,"date":"2015-04-30","message":"Their pizza has always been inferior, in my opinion.
