I watched your report on Donald Trump in Massachusetts last night. Your reporter was great but Don Steele was not unbiased and should be fired. Firstly, it was a huge crowd for Massachusetts ( votes liberal) . DONALD TRUMP MET WITH MANY OF THE FAMILIES THAT WERE MURDERED BY ILLEGALS. A point Don Steele did not want to cover. He was pushing the fact that it was a fund raiser. It was said by reporter, organizer and Donald trump thst the money collected was for food. There was champaign and food. DON STEELE IS SO BIASED AND DOES NOT report THE NEWS. So unprofessional. Where is his sympathy for American families who have no recourse against this invasion and the killing of their loved ones.
