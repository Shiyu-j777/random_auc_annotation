I love his 5 points and that he did not waived. I am, however, very annoyed with President Pena Nieto trying to paint himself and his government as cooperate and caring for his own people. I noticed that he made big mistakes for his country. One of them was his country depend mostly on US for jobs, resources, production, manufacture, revenue, and \"\"\"\"development of competed manufacturing platform in the North America region\"\"\"\" (? - this is very suspicious - if fact, a lot of what he said and the monetary information he stated are suspicious and false including that decline in undocumented illegal immigrants. 1 million people - Note: there are different classes and education level of Mexicans coming here and how many legally and illegally - and 400,000 export transportation cross the broader. 5.6 million Mexican illegal immigrants in US - highest point was 10 yrs ago when they really started to come over as we been saying for a long time. 6 million \"\"\"\"American\"\"\"\" - or Mexicans? - jobs in America depend on the export. 500 billion in revenue in trade between the two countries on export whereas America got 200 million and Mexico 300 million. Oh, and in 2015 US had 60 million trade deficient with Mexico. We lose money, resources, and jobs. These numbers and facts are not lost or went over my head to me and I am 100% sure is not lost on Mr. Trump. Being a great businessman, and international businessman, it is already calculated areas of improvement, profit and loss, where to gain, etc. and this has given him the opportunity for better planning on our behalf). President Pena Neito should buy more from other countries as well. He SHOULD built stronger relationship with other countries instead of seeing them as competition and finding us as allies to compete against them with because he needs resources and advancement as we do. He is short-changing his people and his country. Pres Neito is not marketing his people skills, creativity, talents, and contribution even those including indigenous natives, whom have no education, resources or limited resources, training except for a trade past down fro generation to generation into the world - not just travel and tourism. President Pena Nieto said that it is HIS priority, HIS administration priority to protect Mexicans wherever they may be. That is \"\"\"\"MY responsiblity\"\"\"\" and he shall continue to abide by it with a passion. Really? How passionate, how responsible is President Pena Neito to protecting his people IN his country against drugs, guns, extortion, death threats, murders, government and enforcement corruption, money laundering and in the US?How much of a priority is it, how passionate, and responsible Pres Neito and his administration are to provide people especially poor Mexicans with education, training, shelter, healthcare, financial support, and source of income that they are getting here and not getting in Mexico? Why haven't they lives improved in Mexico that they have to come here? He and his government should be able to provide for ALL his people. According to United Nation regulations, purposes, objectives, and goals (Thank you, Eleanor Roosevelt) Mexico is NOT an impoverished country with limited resources or destroyed or in serious debt by world or poor economic that makes it okay for Mexican immigrants to receive the resources or care in America that are not receive in their home country, Mexico. THIS IS Pres Pena Neito and his administration responsibilities as well as protecting his people from being dehumanizing, exploited, abused, mislead, and so forth. We are taking care of his people, legal Mexican Americans including illegal Mexicans, so they are able to have food, education, shelter, source of income, healthcare, jobs, talent, and be creativity, and live a content life as well. Should Mexico pay for what Mexicans received here in order for them to live, provide, grow, and advance?We are ALL including legal immigrants from all over the world hard working, respectful, deceit, trusting, skillful, intelligent, talented, law abiding citizens, caring for family and community, AND contribute to the prosperity and advancement of the US even those countries we have a relationship and trade with. We have a the most diverse culture in the world. Is Mexico diverse in different cultures? I doubt they could afford to be. How much of a priority is it, how passionate, protective, and responsible Pres Neito and his administration are listen to these issues from Mexicans in his country as well as here and address them there? I felt Pres Pena Neito was putting a lot of blame on the US of these illegal activities and migration movement, lack of respect, being uncooperative, misinformed and misunderstood when ironically we especially our law enforcement have loudly express our grievance over these issues for years without the proper actions, response, and cooperation of the Mexico government, which they lack on their behalf. Not only that, they allow non-Mexicans illegal immigrants to cross over the broader. Pres Pena Neito should not claimed something he and his administration that he and his administration is not doing and not doing right. He should not blame others for his short-comings and for speaking the truth of the reality of today and what is in America.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9149,"user_ideo":-0.0402,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.81,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":2616},{"user_id":10157562213770643,"comment_id":10153978850146756,"date":"2015-11-27","message":"I'm actually fine with them doing a better job later than others.
