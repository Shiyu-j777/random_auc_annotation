The agents at the FBI are livid that Comey did what he did. They are claiming there was more than sufficient evidence to bring several indictments against Hillary Clinton. It wasn't a slam dunk case, but it had more than a good probability of a conviction for Hillary Clinton. Lynch and Obama made it clear to Comey that if he pressed for an indictment, he would be taking the Democrat nominee for president out of the election. If he failed to get a conviction he would be facing charges of tampering with and changing the outcome of a federal election, to which he would be facing the rest of his life in prison, and Obama and Lynch, as well as others, would see to it that he did. Now you know why he presented his case the way he did and why it was so obvious he was reluctant to not press for an indictment. Hillary's statement to the FBI was intentionally given without a court reporter present or without any recording of her testimony to prevent her from having any further exposure to legal charges like perjury. If she lied to Congress, they have no written FBI deposition to confront Hillary with. This was set up to let her walk without fear of being charged with giving False Testimony or being charged with Obstruction of Justice. This is what those in the \"\"\"\"legalese world\"\"\"\" call a \"\"\"\"Straw Man\"\"\"\" legal charge. (It is a charge designed to make someone appear innocent of the charges!) EXAMPLE: Bill beats up Shirley at their home. Bill is arrested for \"\"\"\"Felony Spousal Abuse\"\"\"\" . Bill's lawyer gets the charges dismissed because Bill is not married to Shirley! (They are only \"\"\"\"live in boyfriend and girlfriend\"\"\"\".) Bill walks out of court totally exonerated of the charges thanks to a technicality! The twist in the case is the arresting officer knew all along Bill was not married to Shirley because the officer and Bill are old fraternity brothers. The officer intentionally charged Bill with something he knew would not stick. Bill would easily have been convicted of Assault and Battery, but he was not charged with that! This is what is known as the \"\"\"\"STRAW MAN\"\"\"\" charge. It is how you make a guilty person appear innocent. This is exactly what was done with the Hillary Clinton case! If she had been charged with \"\"\"\"Destruction of Government Documents\"\"\"\", she would have easily been convicted, because she admitted to doing this! Instead, she was charged with \"\"\"\"Mishandling Classified Documents\"\"\"\" which has wiggle room for reasonable doubt regarding Criminal Intent! I think citizens are finally fed up with the Clintons and the cesspool of corruption that is our current government. Real Americans are ready to take our country back. All of these years of corruption have taken a toll on American lives. Citizens opinions of a lying White House, a corrupt Congress, the \"\"\"\"pay to play\"\"\"\" politicians, the legalese lawyers and lobbyists, big overspending \"\"\"\"welfare mentality\"\"\"\" government, the \"\"\"\"looking for a loop hole\"\"\"\" justice system, the lying media, and our censored educational system with an agenda to dumb down the next generation, is at the lowest point ever. Hillary is on the wrong side of every issue. The British Exit from the EU (Brexit) is just a small sign that real citizens of civilized nations are ready to take their country back. They are sick of the results of open borders and globalization led by power hungry elites. Hillary Clinton has no character or integrity. She is an arrogant, condescending political elite who is only interested in lining the Clinton pockets with donations to the Clinton Foundation (wink, wink) from PACS, lobbyists, and foreign nations that buy access and favors. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an operation used to launder money for the Clintons and other politicians involved in illegal activities. The Clintons are able to use the information of those participating to obtain cover for their activities, or blackmail those who are laundering money through them. Just count the number of politicians who arrive in Washington with nothing, but leave as millionaires and billionaires. Did their votes serve in the best interest of their constituents or did they only benefit themselves? If the representatives of your state fall in this category, then I suggest an investigation be launched. FYI....It has come to light that Comey was (or still is) on the Board of Directors of the Clinton Foundation.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9944,"user_ideo":0.8043,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1536},{"user_id":10104374556929701,"comment_id":10154135247292908,"date":"2015-08-08","message":"of all the politicians out there, you good sir are the only one i reserve a tiney bit of hope for... because if there is anything that the past 25 years of observation as made clear to me is that politics is 90% meaningless theatre. the American people are waking up to that fact... slowly but surely.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3283,"user_ideo":-0.6384,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.4,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":1536},{"user_id":1097643480271596,"comment_id":10154160211974411,"date":"2016-03-18","message":"Hey anonymous we now know who you are.
