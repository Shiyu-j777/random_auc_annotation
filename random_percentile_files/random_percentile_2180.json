B) We want a desired reaction from the public (e.g., fear) C) we offer our desired solution to the problem; a solution that will always further our goals. In this presentation, I will give you a few examples of this technique in practice; to enlighten you about this technique in the best possible way: Example 1 Let us say I want the ice cream that belongs to a child. I cannot just ask the child, \"\"\"\"can I have your ice cream?\"\"\"\" I know he will most certainly say \"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\". So I use the following technique to manipulate him into wanting to give me his ice cream: Stage 1. I invent a fake problem: \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, a ghost will haunt you in the night\"\"\"\". or \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, God will send you to Hell\"\"\"\" or \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, you will be very unlucky\"\"\"\" (ofcourse I know it is not true, but the child doesn't) Stage 2. I get a desired reaction from the child: Fear: \"\"\"\"please save me from this danger\"\"\"\" Stage 3. I now offer the solution to the problem I invented: I will save you from this danger if you give me the ice cream. \"\"\"\"I will talk to God\"\"\"\" or \"\"\"\"I will chase away the Ghost\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: I want the child to give me his ice cream. Example 2 Let us say we want the oil in Iraq. We cannot just say to the countries of the world: \"\"\"\"hey, let us go to iraq and take their oil\"\"\"\". The public as well as the countries of the world will not agree to such a thing. So we use the PRS manipulation technique: Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: We use the media to say: \"\"\"\"Iraq has nuclear weapons and poses a threat to the world\"\"\"\" Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please big brother America, save the world from destruction\"\"\"\" Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"You must let us invade iraq in order to save the world\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: After the countries of the world have agreed to our invasion and occupation of the target country (Iraq), we can then use the occupation as a way to secretly steal oil in the target country. During the occupation, the oil companies - owned by illumicorp members - may secretly fund and even bribe some of the military forces within the occupied areas to kill innocent civilians that get in the way of our plans. The assigned corporations then silently takes possession of the oil within the occupied territory without the world ever knowing about it. Example 3 Objective: We want the oil or opium in Afghanistan Stage 1. Problem: We create a 9/11. We blame 9/11 on Usama Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Stage 2. Desired Reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please America, save us from Usama Bin Laden.\"\"\"\" Stage 3. Solution to the problem we created: The people demand the big brother of the world - America - to step in and invade & occupy Afghanistan. Agenda of the solution: We want the oil a or opium in Afghanistan. Example 4 Let us say we want the people to behave the way we want them to behave. We cannot just say to people: \"\"\"\"Behave the way we want you to behave\"\"\"\". People would not obey us. They would rebel against such a statement. So we use the PRS technique in order to manipulate the public into behaving the way we want them to behave. Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: \"\"\"\"There is an invisible, jealous, vindictive and judgemental God in the sky. If you dont behave, he will send you to a place called Hell.\"\"\"\" Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear / guilt Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"If you behave, we will talk to God and he will forgive you. And do not forget to pay the church tax.\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: We want the people to behave the way we want them to behave, and no other way. We want to maintain our dominance and control over the population. Example 5 We use the same technique when we want the public to vote for new laws that give us more control over the people; laws they would normally not vote for had it not beenfor the PRS technique. Let us say we want to introduce a new law that further our control over the population (i.e., more CCTV cameras and surveilance). We cannot just say to the people: \"\"\"\"let us have more cameras so that we can have more control over you\"\"\"\". They will say \"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\". So we have to scare the public into demanding the cameras themselves - democratically -. We use the Problem Reaction Solution Technique: Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: 9/11 Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please America, save us from the terrorists\"\"\"\" Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"allow us to have more cameras in order to prevent future terrorist attacks within the country\"\"\"\" (The people democratically demand that they are controlled, in order to be protected from the terrorist) Agenda behind solution: We want more cameras and more police control over the people, to further our control over the population. So we have to give the public a valid reason to democratically vote for it.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0391,"user_ideo":-0.2427,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.11,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":2180},{"user_id":850030095134639,"comment_id":538167269707186,"date":"2015-05-08","message":"This story is a bigger tall Tale than the the one about Sweetwater Mosquitoes.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2974,"user_ideo":0.7843,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.38,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":2180},{"user_id":1002955756488250,"comment_id":1214125002010189,"date":"2016-12-24","message":"Getting rid of Obama will drain half the swamp. lol","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9618,"user_ideo":0.8206,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.86,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":2180},{"comment_id":1775125539386801,"date":"2016-03-18","message":"If true story I'll not eat anymore","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9381,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.83,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":2180},{"user_id":1202978736413802,"comment_id":10156200642740354,"date":"2015-09-25","message":"BTW, Hillary was in Iowa yesterday..........","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0924,"user_ideo":-0.6101,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.18,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":2180},{"comment_id":10153741146109205,"date":"2016-07-03","message":"#Trump2016","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9956,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":2180},{"user_id":10201749386892559,"comment_id":10153577694494255,"date":"2015-08-06","message":"How's that workin for 'em????MORE pregnancies from abstention...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0819,"user_ideo":-0.8287,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.17,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":2180},{"comment_id":10153132437824091,"date":"2015-08-04","message":"Firemen","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5923,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.59,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":2180},{"comment_id":1820599868210768,"date":"2016-05-19","message":"Claire LambertonJimmy PettiferStewart PalmerCorey Zammit so cool","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0489,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.12,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":2180},{"user_id":1491279940889586,"comment_id":10154425772909228,"date":"2016-07-30","message":"Or maybe it's none of your business or anyone's tbh, and this family is dealing with a terrible loss and doesn't need your questions or judgement on how much better of a parent you are.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0417,"user_ideo":-0.1043,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.11,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":2180},{"user_id":1133505030055318,"comment_id":10153019688728967,"date":"2015-01-21","message":"Watch webcast I try-on test PC.
