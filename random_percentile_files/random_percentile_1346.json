YO BRO IM VOTING Donald Trump My President ALLTHE WAY TO THE GLORY TO GOD THE FATHER IN THE NAME OF JESUS THE CHRIST AND YOU CAN PUT THAT IN THE BANK AMEN AMEN AND AMEN !!! SHARE WITH THIS ALL Lik Joshua Jumper Donald Trump did not steal your money. Donald Trump did not raise your taxes. Donald Trump did not quadruple the price of food. Trump is not stirring a race war. Trump did not leave any US soldiers in Benghazzi to be slaughtered and desecrated by Muslims. Trump did not send the US Navy to fight for Syrian Al-Qaeda. Trump did not arm ISIS and systematically exterminate Christians throughout the Middle East. Trump did not betray Israel. Trump did not provide financing and technology to Irans nuclear weapons program. Trump did not give our military secrets to China. Trump did not remove our nuclear missile shield in Poland at the behest of Russia. Trump did not shrivel our military, and betray our veterans. Trump did not cripple our economy. Trump did not increase our debt to 20 trillion dollars. Trump did not ruin our credit, twice. Trump did not double African American unemployment. Trump did not increase welfare to a record level for eight years. Trump did not sign a law making it legal to execute, and imprison Americans. Trump did not set free all of terrorists in Guantanamo bay. Trump did not steal your rights, violate US Constitutional law, or commit treason, hundreds of times. Trump is being ripped apart in the news, non stop. Barrack Hussein, Hillary Clinton and the criminals occupying our government, are not. The media is the Democratic Party. Save your culture. Stop listening to them. He has said NOTHING derogatory about MEXICANS .... He has said what American citizens KNOW..... This country has to close its borders to ILLEGAL Immigration! Finally, someone who tells the truth! It's what this country needs! Why did Cruz only become a us citizen 15 months ago? He would still be a Canadian citizen if he wernt running for President. A Texan pointed out when Cruz ran for the Senate he was pro immigration. The Texan said Cruz would not have won Texas had he been for deporting illegals... He's a Nasty guy and he would lose to Hillary. I'm so glad Trump is going to beat him. Trump is way smarter and honest than lying Ted. Not to mention that Ted Cruz ate a booger on live tv. He stole votes from Carson in Iowa and I wouldn't be surprised if he stole more. #Trump Corey Yarmock So sick of lying Ted saying he is exactly like Reagan. Rafael you were born in Canada, you have never created a job or employed one person. Reagan was a life long democrat who was also a Hollywood actor. Lying Ted is nothing more than a sellout to the establishment. So no Ted you are nothing like the great Reagan. #NeverCruz","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":1,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1346},{"comment_id":1897482990533473,"date":"2017-02-19","message":"And he pocketing that 500,000 a day since melania stayin in TRUMP tower.
