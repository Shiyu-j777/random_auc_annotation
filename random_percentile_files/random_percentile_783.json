Who was the last American killed by Russia? However this same Administration consider Saudi Arabia our ally, yet they are accused of funding the 9/11 attack that killed over 3000 Americans. I've had the privilege of visiting both the former USSR Republic of Ukraine in 1992 and Cuba in 2011. In both places, I was asked, \"\"\"\"Why do Americans hate us so much?\"\"\"\". In both places I asked the question; \"\"\"\"Why do you believe we hate you?\"\"\"\". In both places the answer was the same, \"\"\"\"That is what our government tells us.\"\"\"\" So is Russia our enemy? Who is our enemy? During the Democratic debates that question was posed to the five Democratic Candidates. Some said NRA; some said Wall-street; I remember Clinton's answer - Republican Party. Senator Jim Webb said, the soldier who tried to kill me with a grenade, but he's not around anymore. Most candidates could not differentiate between \"\"\"\"opponents\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"enemies\"\"\"\". Only one candidate knew the different and that was US Veteran Jim Webb... an enemy is someone who is trying to kill or harm you. Russia is doing neither - so why is this Administration trying to get us to believe that Russia is our enemy and that Trump is cooperating with the enemy? So I ask you the question I asked those who became my friends in both Ukraine and Cuba... why do you believe Russia is our enemy? They are opponents, but at this point they are not our enemy. More importantly, why the Media Propaganda to make us believe they are our enemy. Like what happened with other facts before... first the media said they hacked our election system. Now they are saying they hacked into DNC and influenced our election. I ask the question, do we as voters have a right to know what came out in Wikileaks? Why did our media did not investigate and report that information to the voters? More importantly, if they hacked into those systems as the CIA claims why are we not investigating how they hacked into Hillary Clinton's private server and what secret information they and others accessed that affected what happened in the Middle East?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9897,"user_ideo":0.1228,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.91,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":783},{"user_id":10102529674334408,"comment_id":691808677649904,"date":"2016-11-21","message":"For it seems clear to me that we were so created that between us all there exists a certain tie which strengthens with our proximity to each other. Therefore, fellow countrymen are preferred to foreigners and relatives to strangers, for with them Nature herself engenders friendship, but it is one that is lacking in constancy. For friendship excels relationship in this, that goodwill maybe eliminated from relationship while from friendship it cannot; since, if you remove goodwill from friendship the very name of friendship is gone; if you remove it from relationship, the name of relationship still remains. Moreover, how great the power of friendship is may most clearly be recognized from the fact that, in comparison with the infinite ties uniting the human race and fashioned by Nature herself, this thing called friendship has been so narrowed that the bonds of affection always united two persons only, or, at most, a few. ~Cicero, De Amicitia","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1345,"user_ideo":-0.539,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.23,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":783},{"user_id":10208215984658540,"comment_id":371184803265065,"date":"2017-01-26","message":"Sharon Fatima soon we will have Nassir","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0907,"user_ideo":-0.4642,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.18,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":783},{"comment_id":1523546014338098,"date":"2016-09-13","message":"What up Evan Dickson hampton va","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7492,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.7,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":783},{"comment_id":1696522697272319,"date":"2016-03-12","message":"No matter what, I support Trump.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.999,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":783},{"user_id":10154298408497221,"comment_id":10154878460376337,"date":"2016-11-22","message":"Looks more like beefsqautch","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6596,"user_ideo":-0.4041,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.64,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":783},{"user_id":10209184826925502,"comment_id":959345844076886,"date":"2015-01-15","message":"Besides, if they do a little research, they'll see the national debt has dropped by about 2/3s.
