Take it from me, an Ethiopian Israeli ¡°Israel is one of the most racist countries in the world,¡± said Tahunia Rubel, an Ethiopian-born Israeli model and actress. The remarks by Rubel, who became famous on the Israeli version of ¡°Big Brother,¡± were published in the mass-circulation daily Yedioth Ahronoth last weekend. I¡¯ve spent 21 years in Israel, the total number of my years on earth, in a country totally different from the one where Israelis so angry at Rubel live. Rubel said things like ¡°We have a screwed-up government ¡¦ and the police are total idiots.¡± She added: ¡°People in Israel find it strange to see an Ethiopian woman who behaves like an Israeli.¡± According to a report this week by the Berl Katznelson Foundation, the interview stirred particularly violent posts on social networks. Israel commits racist crimes. A prominent example is the police violence during the demonstrations by young Ethiopian men and women a year ago. (Police violence, incidentally, isn¡¯t limited to young Ethiopians; many young Arabs encounter it as well.) Another example is the investigation that revealed the pressure on Ethiopian women to receive shots of the birth control hormone Depo-Provera before immigrating. So you belong to a minority and you want to express criticism? They¡¯ll immediately remind you that you shouldn¡¯t take for granted that you're here and will suggest that you return to your country of origin. That¡¯s if you¡¯re Ethiopian, of course, because leftist Israel-haters are sent to Berlin regardless of their ethnicity.
