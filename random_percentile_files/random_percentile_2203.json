DOW is at record level. Canada and Mexico have announced they are willing to renegotiate NAFTA with the US. It's only been two days.......Bless those who put Trump in office.Small groups of people have been marched the streets of American cities to protest the results of a free and fair election. The scene on college campuses around America has been even more absurd with students staging \"\"\"\"cry-ins\"\"\"\" and demanding that classes be postponed so they have time to grieve. It's all so thoroughly embarrassing. And I say that especially as a member of this generation. What we're witnessing are nothing more than massive, organized temper tantrums. And that's the nicest way to put it. If thousands of white conservatives had marched in protest of Obama's election, I have no doubt that the media would paint it as a violent, racist insurrection. I won't go that far in this case, but it is a troubling display all the same. The protesters insist that Trump is \"\"\"\"not their president\"\"\"\" and he's \"\"\"\"got to go\"\"\"\" because he's a racist bigot and so are his supporters. But here's the newsflash for these confused young people: He IS your president. And no, he doesn't \"\"\"\"have to go.\"\"\"\" He won the election. It's over. That's how this works. The irony here is that Democrat voter turnout was down significantly this year. Hillary will finish with about 7 million fewer votes than Obama. Trump will finish with fewer votes than any Republican presidential candidate in the last 20 years. What that means is that, most likely, if these kids had mobilized like this a day earlier, they very likely would have won the election. Instead, many of them stayed home and waited until they lost to suddenly decide that they can't tolerate the notion of a Trump presidency. Lazy and entitled. Fulfilling every negative stereotype of my generation. What this really comes down to is that Millennials -- most of them anyway -- just lost a presidential election for the first time. And they can't handle it. And this is the result. And it's truly embarrassing:","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9936,"user_ideo":0.0445,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":2203},{"comment_id":10154295560039607,"date":"2017-01-26","message":"I guess congratulations is probably a little out of line..!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5572,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.57,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":2203},{"user_id":1263788706985109,"comment_id":1581280778830630,"date":"2016-02-29","message":"Oscars are so over.

The Service flag, also called the Blue Star Flag, was designed and patented by WWI Army Captain Robert L. Queisser of the 5th Ohio Infantry who had two sons serving on the front line. The flag quickly became the unofficial symbol of a child in service. President Wilson became part of this history when in 1918 he approved a suggestion made by the Women's Committee of the Council of National Defenses that mothers who had lost a child serving in the war wear a gold gilt star on the traditional black mourning arm band. This led to the tradition of covering the blue star with a gold star on the Service flag to indicate that the service member has died. During WWII the practice of displaying the Service flag became much more widespread. Most flags were hand made by mothers across the nation. One of the most famous flags was that of the five Sullivan brothers who all perished on the U.S.S. Juneau. The Blue Star Mothers was founded as a Veteran Service Organization and was part of a movement to provide care packages to military members serving overseas and also provided assistance to families who encountered hardships as a result of their son or husband serving in the war. In 1960 Congress chartered the Blue Star Mothers of America as a Veterans Service Organization and in 1966, the Department of Defense revised the specifications for design, manufacture and display of the Service flag. The Department of Defense specifies that family members authorized to display the flag include the wife, husband, mother, father, stepmother or father, parent through adoption, foster parents, children, stepchildren, children through adoption, brothers, sisters and half brothers or sisters of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States. The flag should be displayed in a window of the residence of persons authorized. The Service flag may also be displayed by an organization to honor the members of that organization serving during a period of war or hostilities. The Service Flag is an indoor flag and should be flown facing out from the front window of the home or organization. If the U.S. flag is also displayed with the Service flag, the U.S. flag should be of equal or greater proportions and should take the place of honor above the Service flag. Each blue star on the flag represents a service member in active duty. A gold star is displayed if a service member is killed in action or dies in service. If several stars are displayed by one family the gold star takes the honor of being placed at the top. The gold star should be slightly smaller than the blue star to create a blue border surrounding the gold star. Display of a Service Star Banner is done during times of war. Once again families are displaying banners at home.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5669,"user_ideo":0.8257,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.58,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":2203},{"comment_id":10153356277864705,"date":"2015-06-02","message":"ITS A HE or at best an IT.
