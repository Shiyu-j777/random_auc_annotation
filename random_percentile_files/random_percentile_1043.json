So when two black holes collide, you just get one, bigger black hole. You can think of it as the larger one absorbing the smaller, but unless there's a huge size difference, it's more of a mutual event. The energy calculations are due to the way mass/energy is released upon crossing the event horizon, I believe. When matter crosses the event horizon, some of it flashes away as high energy waves; if you have two /massive/ objects colliding, a lot of energy would be released. As to how the calculated how much energy, I have no idea. They have years of higher math, I have one.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0914,"user_ideo":-0.4706,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.18,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1043},{"comment_id":10153749968665950,"date":"2016-07-19","message":"When your in the post of Sec. of State you have a duty to that post, like one duty is to be in charge to over see the U.S. Embassies around the World.
