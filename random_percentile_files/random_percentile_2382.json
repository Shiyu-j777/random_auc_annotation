These are now preserved for posterity behind sheets of plastic. Who would have guessed that during the lifetime of Elizabeth, fascism would rear it's ugly head again? This time from the nation that helped liberate Europe from The Nazis; the perpetrator from that era (Germany) now the sanctuary for those fleeing war and persecution elsewhere. Not a direct parallel - you can never step in the same river twice - but we live in the post-Nazi world where we've supposed to have learned the lessons of that era and we expect human life and dignity to have much more value. A real stark irony. Now Elizabeth has to play host to this man; a consequence of populist policies that led to The Brexit and the need to pursue trade deals. Trump may not be Hitler, but he is defining a new era of fascism that will forever be synonymous with his name. It's not too late to stop it.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":2382},{"user_id":1100455739990925,"comment_id":1756009464679468,"date":"2016-08-28","message":"That is so well written, wonder if he will read it or have it read to him","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4115,"user_ideo":0.4721,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.47,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":2382},{"comment_id":10155135520596729,"date":"2016-10-25","message":"This is a VERY IMPORTANT ELECTION YEAR, lets stick with the issues, so i want to share some truth, i know that some of you would agree its really sad how this great country has gotten so corrupted within goverment through our political system that the 2nd debate was evident that Trump is running not only against Hillary but the Mainstream Corporate Media, Hollywood, Demoncrats and Republicans which in reality they are Republicans In Name Only (RINO) they only care about themselves , CASH and POWER.
