It's sad that you have put yourself on a pedestal and believe yourself to be above others who are simply trying to live a better life. Most of these people come from countries that subject them to terrible conditions. I have nothing against deporting criminals who committed violent crimes, but the lack of empathy toward other human beings whose only crime was to cross a border (whether crossing the actual border or overstaying their time through a visa) is what is truly troubling. Illegal immigrants and permanent residents are all afraid. To be clear, the vetting process and pathway to citizenship was much simpler back in the day.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.004,"user_ideo":-0.0713,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":76},{"user_id":10206813144788132,"comment_id":10152802844420927,"date":"2015-07-01","message":"If I had small children in todays Marxist climate, I would do everything to insure that my children did NOT go to a government-run daycare.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9981,"user_ideo":0.8711,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.95,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":76},{"comment_id":10153567025461509,"date":"2015-04-16","message":"Dump the Muslims overboard so they can find them?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8897,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.79,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":76},{"user_id":10205949090961400,"comment_id":861037914032645,"date":"2016-11-16","message":"What about the reverse harassment the students are imposing on the other students supporting the president elect?!
