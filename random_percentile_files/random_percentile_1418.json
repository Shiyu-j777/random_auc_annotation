What I'm saying is to say this to black people after a lot of our own people not people from slavery time but the civil rights movement, tell us we need to fight Muslim don't really click because we still waiting from justice on the people who cause terror to our people because I constantly hear every time I bring up injustice is \"\"\"\"what about black on black crime\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\" you should worry about black on black crime\"\"\"\". Well I'm hear to day this America might need to worry about the domestic terrorist first who has used the Bible to justify they action. Not make another law because that all what was done. Not justice for my people. A lot of them domestic terrorist went back home in peace. But they rising again. So my question again how are you going to convince black people that my American neighbor isn't a more threat to me than a Muslim in another country. By the way putting the Muslim religion as a whole isn't right just like people tell black people blaming all whites for white people in the past not right.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0015,"user_ideo":-0.2705,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1418},{"user_id":10206752925238218,"comment_id":10153778537932293,"date":"2016-05-01","message":"America will respond strongly against the Democratic Party's move toward Socialism, crushing deficit spending, illegal immigration, illegal amnesty proffers, executive orders, a ruined health care insurance system, sanctuary cities, same sex marriage, transgenderism, disengaging our southern border controls, unvetted refugees and immigrants AND THATS JUST AT HOME! Here's how: Restoring Article 1 A Convention of the States under Article 5 of the United States Constitution, The first issue could be restoring Article I of the United States Constitution. When the founders created the Federal Government, and the Congress, They stated that the two entities must be represented equally, to serve \"\"\"\"We the People.\"\"\"\" They created House of Representatives, know as the PEOPLES HOUSE to represent the people in their districts. There is a reason why there is an election every two years for the House, if they are not serving their district well-they can be replaced quickly. The Senate was created to represent the RESPECTIVE STATES, in which we the people reside, the senators from 1792 to 1913 WERE NOT ELECTED by popular election, but faced election in their respective state legislatures and could be RECALLED by the Governor of the state if they were not properly representing their respective state. Today most Americans think of the United States Senators as representing us in Congress, when in fact THEY ACTUALLY DO NOT, and because of this, the members of the House are NOT PROPERLY not representing us either. Until we restore this key section (Article 1) of the constitution we will never completely get the National Governmant back on the right track. In addition to reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interests - the United States Senate is regarded by most as a country club and the senators often act contrary to the wishes of their State and more often align themselves with a national political party. We should return power over the Senate to the State Legislatures. Beyond that we have to introduce term limits for both the House and Senate. I hope you'll check out Convention of the States on FaceBook. We might not agree on much, but surely most can agree we need to take back control of our National Checkbook. A Balanced Budget Amendment, that'll reduce the influence of special interests and lobbyists. Then Congress has to listen to We The People, all year round-not just election season.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.7848,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1418},{"user_id":1439195856096118,"comment_id":1296400607056656,"date":"2016-04-21","message":"i like the idea of Harriet Tubman being on the 20, but why does it matter who's face is on it as long as it gets the bills paid, and put food on our tables and clothes on our backs.
