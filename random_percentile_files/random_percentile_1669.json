If they werent threatening families of the drivers, If they were peaceful then the police wouldnt have got involved. The miners held the country to ransom countless times. Many a night in the 70's we were without power just because the miners wanted more money and piss what was in your fridge or freezer. Hospitals worked by candlelight. You tossers think thats acceptable? They had the upper hand always. If it wasnt for Maggie we would still be in the ages of power cuts because these fools want and expect more money. These people brought this on themselves. For years the police were spat at, bricks and bottles thrown at them by scum miners. The moment they retaliate (after years of the abuse) you nobs call them for it. And I take it most of you fools want to remain in the EU, so look at the European countries police, how they deal with rioters. They wade in military style, dont have to explain themselves and dont have pansy tw*ts complaining like this. Maybe if we had stayed then our police wouldve had that privilege too. Why is everyone trying to claim things? Anything for money.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.427,"user_ideo":-0.2609,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.48,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1669},{"user_id":1046953418675140,"comment_id":10157320631970093,"date":"2016-07-27","message":"Admire , bwahaha","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.598,"user_ideo":0.788,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.6,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1669},{"user_id":1578546805780060,"comment_id":10155881370245354,"date":"2015-07-18","message":"I think they should all go back except maybe the older ones but especially Obama","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9963,"user_ideo":0.7441,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.94,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1669},{"user_id":10157027869355467,"comment_id":725979277560858,"date":"2017-01-21","message":"He already ordered the National Park Service to stop using its Twitter account.

The sanctions against Russia is a farce blind man. You blindly trust a government that has proven time and time again they are untrustworthy.

That's the bigger picture you don't see. Do you think we don't do the same thing to our adversaries? Wake up Gunny... You can't see the forrest through the trees.
