Every paragraph in this column would have been laughably unbelievable 18 months ago. Putin interfering in the U.S. election? President Trump? A pro-Russian administration? But when this slowly unfolded, day by day, and inch by inch, we gradually became de-sensitized to the change that Trump has brought to America: campaigning on lies, turning America’s foreign policy on its head, and making the United States a subordinate ally to Russia.\"\"\"\" And yes, it's terrifying. We have reason to fear that Trump will hand over sensitive intelligence to Putin; green-light further Russian aggression against Ukraine and the Baltic states; connive at the destruction of the EU; help orchestrate electoral victories by Marine Le Pen and other extreme-right figures; undermine international institutions vital to democracy, human rights, anti-corruption, and the environment; support Assad as he continues his crimes against humanity; exacerbate the refugee crisis in order to destabilize Europe; strengthen a transnational authoritarian network that includes Duterte and Erdogan; accelerate fossil fuel extraction; sabotage alternative energy; and pursue any number of other destructive and destabilizing policies we can barely imagine.'","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0039,"user_ideo":-0.3252,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1282},{"comment_id":1584672948219396,"date":"2016-11-27","message":"Trolls paid minimum wage by big oil to comment negatively","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0359,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.1,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1282},{"user_id":10210202843936868,"comment_id":1424824810891706,"date":"2016-09-27","message":"The increase in school shootings is NOT because people stopped hitting their kids and it's ignorant to imply otherwise. Kids deserve to not be hit. I'm sorry you don't feel that way, but if it's not legal for me to hit YOU on your ass with a piece of wood, why should it be ok for anyone to treat the most helpless in our society that way? Just gross. We're talking about CLOTHES and sexist dress codes, and you creeps that hit your kids decide that's the problem.
