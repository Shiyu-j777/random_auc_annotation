The thing with this one is that Liberals, like always, are wrong. Donald Trump’s “America First” message appeals to millions of Americans. His followers come from all walks of life. They come from all ethnicities. I mean it. Look around the Facebook right now. Look at the people that support Donald Trump. There are a lot of white people, but then when you start looking there are just as many minorities that have joined the Trump Train. There is a reason for this. *** Everyone in America wants the same thing. We all want security, prosperity and sovereignty. We all want something that the globalist politicians that have taken over this country cannot provide. Let’s look at a Chinese American realtor named, Tony Xu Xu, who became an American citizen to the United States in 2008. He voted for Obama, but after looking at Democratic policies he is an active supporter of Trump. “When we came to the U.S., you hear that Democrats are always on the side of minorities. But if you study their policies in detail, we feel it’s the other way around,” Tony told Vocativ. “Democrats help those who don’t want to work and penalize those who want to achieve the American Dream.” Whoop. Meet Asians for Trump. They are hard working, family oriented group of Americans that want common sense conservatism back into Washington DC. Fuck that constitutional conservatism anyways. They had their chance with Ted Cruz. I mean. What does it even mean to be a constitutional conservative? (h/t Truth Feed, Vocativ) 127784-full-1 If you’re an Asian American for Trump or you know any, please send this around. Let’s get everyone on board to make America great again. *** Let’s welcome every American onto the Trump Train!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.0893,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":290},{"comment_id":1025537600820045,"date":"2015-04-30","message":"Main stream news is a corporation, and with government and corporations it also a lying bias propaganda machine.
