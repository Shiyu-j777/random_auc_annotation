Also abortion come from the Latin word aboriri which means miscarry. You have to miscarry. The baby is gone during this procedure. Are you also aware of the size of a child at full term? You don't just poke and prod and get baby pieces. Not to mention the fact that most if not ALL mother's want to hold their child. To see their baby that they spent so much time nurturing hoping to give birth to and hear crying. Have you even looked up how an abortion would be done? You can't just vacuum the child. Too big. The safest way to remove the lost child is C-section unless it is deemed safe by the doctor to give birth. And yes you can give birth to a lost child. You are induced into labor. You want to tell me how abortion works? Have you had one? Have you experienced it at the side of the poor woman who had to make that decision?? Have you preformed one? I don't fucking think so. Cause if you have you'd be aware that a C-section is called for when it is a medical emergency. Be it abortion, or living birth.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0039,"user_ideo":-0.6135,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1745},{"user_id":1080477388702851,"comment_id":10154260721335586,"date":"2016-07-13","message":"Yet we tax payers pay for their trip","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9288,"user_ideo":-0.1,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.82,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1745},{"user_id":1484012034958122,"comment_id":1420341111345381,"date":"2016-12-08","message":"Guess I'll be dead being I'm in dialysis","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5004,"user_ideo":-0.5765,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.53,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1745},{"user_id":10154410426726926,"comment_id":10153620277119087,"date":"2016-03-19","message":"They have been indoctrinated by Gramsci in the school system.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9238,"user_ideo":0.638,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.82,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":1745},{"comment_id":1845959202283728,"date":"2017-01-21","message":"Libs...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9923,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.92,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1745},{"user_id":10155023885499240,"comment_id":1141580405862137,"date":"2016-05-10","message":"As opposed to taking firefighters off line for several hours for a five minute pic with Stevie Harper as PM, ???","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0218,"user_ideo":-0.4702,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.08,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1745},{"comment_id":2224762384415938,"date":"2017-02-12","message":"Danny lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.093,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.18,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1745},{"user_id":1037899762991529,"comment_id":1323432204382920,"date":"2017-01-05","message":"\"\"\"\"Toyota has a large presence in the United States with six major assembly plants in Huntsville, Alabama, Georgetown, Kentucky, Princeton, Indiana, San Antonio, Texas, Buffalo, West Virginia, and Blue Springs, Mississippi.\"\"\"\" This statement is from Wikipedia.
