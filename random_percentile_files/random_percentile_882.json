First, honey are only responsible for 12-15% of pollination worldwide. They aren't even native to North America (the pilgrims brought them, the Indians called them White Flies). They ARE responsible for 80% pollination out there in that corporate farm field. Where these idiots killed off ALL the natural pollinators (native bees, bumble, sweat, all the wasp, flies, and chased away all the birds and small animals that play a bigger roll in pollination) with their weekly dosing of pesticides. They/honey bees are just about worthless when it comes to \"\"\"\"tripping\"\"\"\" the plant (digging deep into bloom) for honey bees are happy to collect the pollen at the top of the bloom. Hence why they are only 12-14% responsible for pollination in a clean environment. With this \"\"\"\"poor honey bee\"\"\"\" campaign, Monsanto managed (actually wrote the bills at one of their many ALEC meetings...oh you never heard of ALEC...go look it up. This is where our Representatives and corporate leaders get together and create LEGISLATION...no kidding) to get a handful of states to push out billions of taxpayers dollars to \"\"\"\"save the honey bee\"\"\"\". Same bees that they release into those pesticide drenched fields. You do know they truck these bees in. Nothing NATURAL happening there. And that honey from those bees..POLLUTED. So my friend, YOU have fallen victim to yet another CORPORATE scam. What should be \"\"\"\"saved\"\"\"\" is the NATURAL order in any region. AgriGrowth (oh you didn't know that these corps are all \"\"\"\"umbrella\"\"\"\" into one big monster, doing AgriBusiness, actually Bayer was already a \"\"\"\"member\"\"\"\"...and that CRF frozen food massive recall...well lo and behold Offutt/CRF is a member), is just a self greasing greed fueled NWO (make chemicals, spray out all chemicals, make more chemicals...while feeding/SELLING us their CHEMICALS, and increasing their production of chemicals and STOCK) hellbent on taking over the worlds food and SEED. Yep... Don't even want us to grow our own food. I would go on about those GMO seeds (ya HAVE to spray this new formulated \"\"\"\"Glycophate\"\"\"\"/RoundUp in which Glycophate is NOT the culprit, the surfactant, now 60% of that bottle, and proven to be wildly carcinigious, for the seed will not sprout without this \"\"\"\"synergist\"\"\"\")...Ahhh I grow organically, FCHP, former Penn State Master Gardener, held 3 different pesticide applicators licenses, my entire life in horticulture, agriculture, and been fighting Monsanto since the late 80s, when they first started going \"\"\"\"rogue\"\"\"\", buying politicians and votes. Have you heard of the Monsanto Protection Act? Well Barry just re-upped it. Monsanto wrote it (ALEC) and it makes it impossible for ANY Fed, State or local government to sue them. Peace and prosperity to you and remember to vote out every incumbent (our true cause for our real misery) in every election, everywhere.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0047,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":882},{"user_id":10210055641814535,"comment_id":10153201651051336,"date":"2015-04-28","message":"All I saw was THUGS looting and being THUGS.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9559,"user_ideo":0.3688,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.86,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":882},{"user_id":1247972621893519,"comment_id":10154192237548352,"date":"2016-01-29","message":"Amen","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6788,"user_ideo":-0.4403,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.65,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":882},{"user_id":10207163783517082,"comment_id":10152943548209071,"date":"2015-07-10","message":"#2-really?
