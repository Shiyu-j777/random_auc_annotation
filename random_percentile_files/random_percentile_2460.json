They are not teaming up; they are colluding because it takes the mind of a coward criminal to block despotically the votes of the people in favor of their ambition. I guess those are the conservative values, principles and dignity they talk about with those mouthfuls of despair for the rest of us. But we the people decide who wins and who's a loser in this race and our vote is solid for Donald Trump all the way. These two cheaters are gone already and the saddest part is they worked all the time for the Trump cause without knowing. No, there are no more debates for Cruz including Mr. Trump; Donald won them all long time ago. If Cruz needs media coverage he will have to show the money or concede and move over to Cuba where he belongs.
