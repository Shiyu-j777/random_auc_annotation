Why would I want to intentionally want to make someone feel worse than they already do??? While I am anti-abortion when it comes to murdering innocent babies because they are an inconvenience doesn't mean that I sit here and judge every woman that walks through a PP door. I am just against abortion. I can dislike the lap band procedure and not dislike the patient or Dr. doing the procedure. However, as wrong as it may be, you have judged me by my beliefs and I have judged you by yours! I would've been less like to have if I hadn't been talked to like I was some kind of Republican Nazi (I am NOT republican. I am an independent and even voted for Obama his first go around!!!) This whole discussion started with gun control. And, my personal opinion about it. You can disagree with me ALL. DAY. LONG. And I will calmly sit and listen. But DO NOT expect me to calmly sit and listen when I'm being cussed at like a sailor. That really DOES show the decline of our nations moral character. We can agree to disagree. But cursing at me only shows me that you have nothing tangible or relevant for me to understand. I've known WAY too many illiterate people who use vulgar language to make themselves look 'smart'. Therefore, I don't accept that cussing is a sign of intelligence. I have an ex-brother-in-law that was absolutely stupid who used his vulgar mouth to verbally abuse my sister so I have NO USE for people who use vulgarity to belittle or bully anyone.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9928,"user_ideo":0.3199,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.92,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1072},{"comment_id":1367358586632892,"date":"2017-02-23","message":"WeThePeople kept this gang there for 8 years, go figure","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9333,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.83,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1072},{"user_id":644179632424633,"comment_id":10154198668066509,"date":"2015-11-07","message":"Regardless how you feel about Carson, the media gave Obama a pass on his self proclaimed Marxist autobiography","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9987,"user_ideo":0.3679,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.96,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1072},{"comment_id":1175600405806545,"date":"2016-05-05","message":"This breaks my heart and brings me to tears.
