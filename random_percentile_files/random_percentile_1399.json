Christians aren't banned from celebrating Christmas in Brunei. In fact, Christmas is officially a public holiday in Brunei and has been so for decades. Something the media 'conveniently' omits in the articles ---- anti-Brunei articles, may I add. In Brunei, Christians are allowed to practice their religions in their homes, churches and communities. What is banned, however, is extravagant public Xmas celebrations (and decorations). Otherwise, it is permissible for Christians to celebrate it. SUMMARY: Brunei doesn't ban other faiths from celebrating their customs and traditions. 25th Dec - still a public holiday. Media is bias. Check your facts. Media is taking things out of context.

TED AND HEIDI CRUZ !!!!!SHARE THIS EVERY WHERE !!! TED CRUZ IS THE PREACHER that said( he thinks gays should be killed ) there is a video with Cruz saying this on you tube AND HIS CULT CHURCH agreed with him . !!!!! CRUZ FOLLOWERS are Tricked by his BIG LIES !!!! TRUMP IS A CONSERVATIVE !!!!THE LIBERAL IS CRUZ !!!! HIS FATHER IS CUBAN !!!! HE IS HILLARY IN A MANS BODY !!! HILLARY CLINTON ALSO RECEIVED MONEY FROM GOLDMAN SACKS !!!!, You MUST know these things! Educate yourselves on him and his wife * Heidi Cruz has been employed by Goldman Sachs since 2005. She is currently on leave. * Heidi Cruz is a member of the leftist council on foreign relations, advocates of world Government and a New World Order. * Ted Cruz was George Bush's top policy advisor. * Ted Cruz was in the federal Trade Commission. * Ted and Heidi met when they were both Bush staffers.( BIG LIE ) TEDDY WHOSE REAL NAME IS RAPHAEL and HEIDI ARE BLOOD COUSINS. * Cruz advised on legal affairs and Heidi on economic policy for the bush administration. * Heidi was director for the Western Hemisphere on the national security council under Condoleeza Rice. * Heidi served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative to USTR head, Robert Zoellick, working on China trade policy. * Ted Cruz' campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, is a former CIA officer. He also worked for Goldman Sachs. * Ted Cruz voted for cloture on TPA, (trans pacific partnership agreement) fast track trade authority, removing the hurdle of concern for further amendment, and clearing the way for passage! It didn't have to be recorded, so nobody knew this. He voted NOT to require approval of congress before other countries could join, including China. * Cruz has openly stated that he will NOT use a deportation force, and will continue to use the failed ICE system, where an illegal has to commit a crime first, then be caught. * Cruz belongs to the radical Christian sect of 7 mountains dominionism, that seeks to place their members in control of our culture and create a NWO though the domination of business, government, media, arts & entertainment, education, family, and religion. He is the appointed messiah/savior of their group. * Ted Cruz has only been a citizen for about 19 months! He renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014 so he could run for president. There are also other reasons that he is not constitutionally eligible, including the fact that both of his parents were NOT U.S. Citizens when he was born, only his mother was. Wise up, he's not who you think he is he has always been establishment, he is bought and paid by the banks. He did not vote to audit the Federal Reserve, he most certainly is establishment.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1399},{"user_id":311078969244762,"comment_id":10154055961476336,"date":"2016-02-14","message":"The Sudan was handing Osama bin Laden over on a silver platter and Billy Clinton was too busy entertaining Interns and had no foreign policy just like Obama and just like his wife. Billy Clinton appointed George Tenet to the CIA and Tenet is a devout Democrat and was a disgruntled employee who was caught cooking the books at the CIA and it was his information about WMD's that he gave to Colin Powell that was either a lie or just plain wrong and the only two people that have apologized for Iraq has been Condi Rice and President Bush and we have heard zilch from Colin Powell other than helping his boy Obama out by blaming President Bush and we will never hear an apology from a democrat especially Tenet. As for President Bush's apology, he apologized for getting it wrong but he refuses and should not have to apology for protecting the USA from terrorism and further terrorist attacks and for getting rid of a heinous dictator. In addition, WMDs did exist and I will reiterate what I always say because I have heard the same thing from Iraqis from Mosul, from Baghdad, and from Basra that if Hussein could drain the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers and swamps in Iraq, he could hide WMDs and those same people watched their loved ones be exterminated by WMDs and they also watched or were forced to help transport those WMDs over the Iraqi border into Syria and those stories were told to me a decade ago before the Syrian conflict. As for Trump, if you dislike Obama well imagine a country with Trump as leader--not much difference. And even though 9/11/01 happened 8 months after President Bush took office, the planning and plotting of this attack was taking place during Trump's buddy Bill Clinton's (who Trump also supported) presidency when the terrorists were here on expired VISAs and learning to fly planes with expired VISAs. Trump also proved last night that he will only start wars and send our men and women into war not to protect this country but for financial reasons and financial gains to help his pocket because those reasons came from his own mouth and words.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9802,"user_ideo":0.8422,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1399},{"comment_id":10154436026159062,"date":"2015-11-08","message":"No common sense again and hard headed you must follow the orders of a police officer regardless of what you think the constitution says. ...when you are confronted with a police officer (COMPLY) and fight it in court ..
