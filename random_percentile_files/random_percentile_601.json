I like a politicians who work with people to achieve their common goal for the good of all Americans. Extremists are trouble from the start either your right or left. I've been a member of NRA., for 17 years and I do understand Obama on gun issue since he become a president. The problem is not understanding his gun proposal, the problem is accepting his proposal as legitimate form of resolution to gun problem in this country. I've owned guns for 20 years and my 2nd Amendment right cannot be repeal or altered, but the world is changing and the president is darn right about guns should not be obtained by those unstable mind, criminals and terrorist.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0327,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.1,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":601},{"user_id":10210108111797965,"comment_id":10153645740893525,"date":"2016-04-20","message":"One black president out of our entire history and now one piece of currency...
