It is simply the \"\"\"\"radical\"\"\"\" idea that society favors white people over people of color, and it is completely prevalent in every aspect of life. Having privilege does not mean that you don't struggle or work hard. It has nothing to do with that. It just means that you have an advantage in everyday life because of the color of your skin. This page is full of people who are mainly white and who do not recognize their own privilege. And white privilege is different than other types of privilege in that it is systematic. In society, there will always be the underpinnings of racism in everything that happensm from who the hall monitor decides to stop and check for a pass at a high school to how police officers restrain people differently based on their race. I am not saying that white people get what they have for free, and that is not what white privilege is. White privilege is knowing that when you wake up the next day, society will treat you with the respect that you deserve, the respect that strangely disappears when society interacts with a person of color. Don't be fucking ignorant.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":910},{"user_id":10207129096891465,"comment_id":10154502634391336,"date":"2016-08-05","message":"Explain how anyone can be more dangerous than Hilary Clinton who shouldn't even have a security clearance for her incompetence and treason acts of bribery from foreign governments","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9647,"user_ideo":0.7853,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.87,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":910},{"comment_id":493980790802617,"date":"2016-05-31","message":"The people demanding charges for child abuse or negligence are only doing so because the gorilla died.
