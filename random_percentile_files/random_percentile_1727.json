You do realize that the Republican and Democratic parties have been taken over by multi-national corporations, the academic Elite, and even governmental bodies that want Global governance. Donald Trump is an outsider and the establishment will do everything in their power, Republican and Democrat, to take him down because he goes against the grain. He speaks his mind and he won't be put into the establishments little box. Hillary Clinton has scandals going back to the 1980s. She's been involved in insider trading, there's a lot of people that have known her that have come up dead under mysterious circumstances, she perjured herself in front of Congress, she lied about the emails she's stole the primary election from Bernie Sanders and you want this person as our president? The person that says when she landed in Kosovo she was under sniper fire and then they played the tape and nothing of the sort happened? I've been on both sides of the aisle I grew up Republican I quickly changed to Democrat after Bush's Wars the National Defense authorization Act the Patriot Act and other unconstitutional legislation. I worked on Obama's campaign in 2008 for three months. I believed everything he said, 90% of it or more turned out to be a lie so I started digging a little deeper. Multinational corporations, Elite people in government have a revolving door system and they have captured our Republic. Although Donald Trump is not perfect by any means he's the best chance that we have at getting America back on track. If we vote in Hillary things will stay the same. Actually they will keep getting worse just like under Obama, and she will continue Obama's Legacy of destroying the Constitution just like George Bush. It's time to stop with the partisan politics and attacks and get to the truth of the matter that this country has been hijacked by multi-national corporations and we are heading towards a One World Government. In other words, a total tyranny worldwide.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.997,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.94,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1727},{"user_id":10208141522110524,"comment_id":720384408099468,"date":"2016-06-14","message":"John Lennon had it right - ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0293,"user_ideo":-0.6819,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.09,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1727},{"user_id":10210621974290050,"comment_id":10153812020011336,"date":"2015-11-05","message":"Stupid","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.777,"user_ideo":0.73,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.71,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1727},{"user_id":10208993062937006,"comment_id":1040121512728725,"date":"2016-02-10","message":"so they are not making enough or taking enough of our money?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.542,"user_ideo":0.8609,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.56,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1727},{"user_id":1171184419590256,"comment_id":10153241034610950,"date":"2015-11-22","message":"1) Block first the Klan and Davidians or Davidian Branch 2) America defeated Nazi Germany and the Confederacy, if you love the American ideals you cannot support Nazism, racism, the Klan and son on 3) The Saudi Regime, a brutal and terrorist regime, ruled by Sharia, associated to Bush and Murdoch has the same ideology, Gopers love rich muslims 4) Reagan called the Mujahideen the Founding Fathers of the XX century in moral terms 5) Bush ignored warnings on 9 11 and caused 3000 casualties in Iraq 6) Bush lied about WMD invaded Iraq ignored warnings of civil war and caused 1060000 casualties.
