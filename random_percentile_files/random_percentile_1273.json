We have had in place a version of the ACA which Mitt Romney put into law for decades ago. When my daughter was born with a complex congenital heart defect she needed over a million dollars in medical procedures. Because Massachusetts was one of only two states in the country at the time that did not allow health insurance companies to discriminate against people with preexisting conditions my daughter's hefty medical bills were covered. Otherwise I would have had to sell my business and my home and file for medical bankruptcy and go on Medicare to get my daughter the care she needed. Instead my daughter got her condition treated and is a healthy 21 year old and we have a thriving business that employs 12 people and pays taxes. Sometimes, Destiny, things cannot be measured in simplistic terms, as much as we would like them to be. It isn't always about dollars and cents when human beings are involved. That much I can testify to.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1273},{"user_id":10210096748404082,"comment_id":893711090745273,"date":"2015-07-27","message":"Good eaten...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6384,"user_ideo":0.2641,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.62,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1273},{"user_id":501297396730246,"comment_id":1586143135011991,"date":"2016-06-05","message":"Best policy ever.
