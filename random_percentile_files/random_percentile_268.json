See how simple that is? Why do you presume conservatives ALWAYS have to do whatever Liberals desire? The few times Republicans said absolutely not the President refused any compromise. How do you blame one and not the other? Compromise isn't defined as lay down and let Liberals walk all over you. And BTW-I don't want Abortion in the Hood getting a dime of my tax dollars. They raked in over a billion dollars last year and donated $14 million to Democratic candidates in the mid-term elections alone. They're nothing but a marketing arm for the Democratic party (similar to N.O.W.). What makes your opinion more valuable than mine?! I WANT my elected representatives to reflect my viewpoint and act/vote accordingly. I'm thoroughly fed up with the government not only dismissing conservative concerns but mocking them as well. I'm also fed up with arrogant, patronizing liberals who refuse to compromise on anything yet demand it of everyone else. Ugh! I'm not a Trump supporter but tge way i feel? Yeah. That's why the loudmouth is leading. And yet liberals and RINO's still don't seem to understand exactly how angry many citizens are with the current administration","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9992,"user_ideo":0.5912,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.98,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":268},{"user_id":1396003577081074,"comment_id":10154490749280579,"date":"2016-06-15","message":"Any attempt to negate any of our Rights will not be tolerated.
