She was pure evil. There were several nuns that worked with her who exposed her and her work with the clinic and the orphanages. Hitchens did not have to look for dirt at all. It was Teresa herself that did the most heinous crimes to mankind with her fixation on enjoyment of seeing others suffer. Mother Teresa was the farthest thing from a saint there could possibly be. She ran filthy facilities that the medical professions around the planet tried in vain to close. She diverted all the charitable donations given to the orphanages to the Vatican or used them to built convents. None of that money was ever used to feed the children or went to their care. She was a sadistic care giver who revelled in the pain of those who suffered while dying. Most of what she did was for photo opportunities only for fund raising purposes.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0034,"user_ideo":-0.8165,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":177},{"comment_id":10153744889952217,"date":"2016-07-11","message":"I still vote for Harriet Jones","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2561,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.34,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":177},{"user_id":1075652095897402,"comment_id":926744794122972,"date":"2016-11-02","message":"Exactly","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4148,"user_ideo":0.8015,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.47,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":177},{"user_id":10206820298281428,"comment_id":10156235071030389,"date":"2015-10-12","message":"Honestly, Obama has to go.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9268,"user_ideo":0.7627,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.82,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":177},{"user_id":984333211683,"comment_id":10153372566623869,"date":"2015-12-15","message":"Where's Robert Graves?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1071,"user_ideo":-0.4856,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.2,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":177},{"comment_id":10157067463835557,"date":"2016-06-30","message":"That is the problem they shouldn't be citizens.
