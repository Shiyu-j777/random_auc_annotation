The media as well as the Democratic Party pushes the agenda of the leftist cause, race baiting, political correctness and division. At the present time the media is solidly anti-Trump.

The Media just doesn't get it....they can't believe that people are so angry that they can no longer be manipulated! Millions of trump supporters feel this way about Donald J. Trump..... \"\"\"\"We don't care if the guy swears... or how many times he's been married...or who he voted for, or what his income tax return shows. We want the problems fixed. Yes he's an egomaniac, but we don't care. We know he's not a racist, or bad to women, or all the other things the liberal media is trying to label him with. We know he's raised a good family, and that says a lot about him. The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two faced & gutless, and illegals are everywhere and Muslims are openly trying to hurt this country and make the civilized world adjust to them. We want it all fixed! We don't care that Trump is crude, we don't care that he has changed positions, we don't care that he fights with Megan Kelly, Rosie O'Donnell, and so many of the elected establishment. We don't care that Rubio, Ryan, the Bush's, and so many other top old and new Republicans refuse to endorse him for their own selfish reasons, and we know what they are. We don't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslim terrorists, we don't care that he tried some businesses that didn't work out. This country is weak, bankrupt, our enemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegals, we are becoming a nation of victims, where every Tom, Ricardo and Hasid is a special group with special rights to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in, AND WE JUST WANT IT FIXED. And TRUMP is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want. We're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic and Republican Party. We're angry about the Iran deal, the budget, treatment of Israel, military weakness, lobbyists, special interests, overpaid politicians with their self serving bills and back room deals, trade deals, loss of jobs, manipulated economic numbers, businesses fleeing, and even the phoney pay for play Clinton Foundation. Americans are no longer going to be fooled, and the movement is out to change the direction we're taking. Trump may not be a saint, but he doesn't have lobbyist money holding him, he doesn't have political correctness restraining him, and all you know is that he has been very successful, a good negotiator, he has built a lot of things, he's flexible, and he's also not a politician. And he says he'll fix it. And we believe him because he is too much of an egotist to be proven wrong or looked at and called a liar. Public service has become elected greed. This may be our only chance to have a non-politician, despite his flaws, try and correct the mess, at least for 4 years. We must take the shot, because the consequences of putting Hillary Clinton in office are frightening. There is a tidal wave happening, and its going to overcome much of what's happened to this country.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.7992,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":1,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":39},{"comment_id":1584870905153070,"date":"2016-10-03","message":"Shaimaa Sarah Shereen","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0186,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":39},{"comment_id":10154887229307494,"date":"2016-11-16","message":"Ruben Auditor","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1122,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.2,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":39},{"comment_id":10154424782579342,"date":"2016-11-29","message":"what happened to her","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7026,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.67,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":39},{"user_id":1062557740464607,"comment_id":813509232127192,"date":"2016-04-22","message":"Yeah.
