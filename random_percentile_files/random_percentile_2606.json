What qualified Hillary as a senator or as President, other than she lived as a wife in the White House? Given her lies, how can we believe that she won't serve her best interests first and ours later when it benefits her? Will any world leader take her seriously? Has she won back the respect of our military after Benghazi? In her platform, she has already declared a war on our 2nd Amendment rights. As a woman, I would love to see a strong woman President in my lifetime, but not this one. I cannot vote for a woman who has built her career on dishonesty and deceit. Considering how divided our country has been, I'm willing to give a non-politician a chance. One of Trump's best qualities is that he knows how to motivate and lead people. There is also an honest willingness to make our country better.
