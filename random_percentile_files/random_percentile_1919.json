No one can win this election besides Trump or Clinton. You may believe in your heart you are doing the right thing. That you will sleep better at night, but all of these wasted votes will allow one of these candidates to be elected, the wrong one. You may not believe Trump or trust him but I believe that he has a truer desire for our country to be great and strong again than Clinton will ever have. Hillary is a true politician to the core, dirty, corrupt, self serving agenda motivated scum. Trump is a businessman that may not be tactful, but wants America to be the greatest country in the world again. Please realize that at no point in your life, your children's lives or grandchildren's lives will anyone make everyone happy but Hillary will keep America in the downward spiral we are in now. At the end of the day Trump is your best option for this election.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":1,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1919},{"user_id":10209154159705680,"comment_id":10153333529341336,"date":"2015-06-06","message":"Enough!
