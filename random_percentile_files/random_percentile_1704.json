This is the current monetary policy of the Obama Administration, it is strongly endorsed by Hillary Clinton and every Democrat currently running for office. It is harming millions of our seniors, our mothers and fathers...and in the most cases our grandparents and the disabled. The Federal Reserve appears to be involved in what some consider a criminal conspiracy to devalue the U.S. dollar just after receiving over 2.4 trillion in Federal Income taxes this year. There is no plausible reason the FED should not be attempting to increase the dollar valuation since the money Americans paid in taxes is now losing billions in value each and every day they fail to raise the U.S. interest rate. Their reasoning is to impel U.S. citizens to spent their hard earned money and not to place it in savings. It also allows for foreign governments to take our currency out of the United States and hold until they do decide to raise interest rates. Japan, Russia, China, India, and the European Union are all involved in this conspiracy to devalue currencies around the world. Russia and China in particular have their currencies valued against gold. The valuation on Gold has now reached a point where these countries will be flooding the entire market with real gold as it nears a record high valuation. The bad news is Democrats could care less about those who receive social security. People worry more about the post then they do the millions of dollars being stolen from the elderly by the FED's policy. Or we could look at it another way. Tax payers payed in 2.4 trillion to the government on April 15. Last week the value of the dollar went down over 10%. That about a loss of 2.4 billion in the taxes we just paid the government. Great FED policy. Then the Chinese swapped GOLD at it's highest valuation for our cheap US dollar and they'll use that to come buy another US corporation while our senior citizens got poorer again The Chinese will have discounted cheap U.S. currency they can now purchase once they flood the entire commodity market with gold. The result of this FED collusion will be massive corporate and bank profits while senior citizens, pensioners, veteran retirees and fixed income workers will have less money and even lower savings. Our FED has explicitly stated they want Americans spending their money and not placing it into savings. It is cheaper for our corporations to leave the U.S. and set up businesses elsewhere then to remain in our own country. When they raised the interest rate last fall, it was decided not to give social security recipients a cost of living increase. This was due to the fact they intended to raise the interest rate up to 4X in 2016. Raising the rates would have justified the loss of a cost of living increase for those on social security. Instead, they have done everything in their power to devalue the US dollar against foreign currencies. They have done nothing but hurt those receiving social security and the savings of retirees. Talk to every senior citizen on social security who was denied a cost of living increase. They live on a fixed income and this devaluation of the dollar is hurting our most vulnerable senior citizens. This is a government conspiracy to devalue the dollar in order to prop up foreign currencies at the expense of the most vulnerable citizens in this county. The savings rate at each and every bank in this country for U. S. citizens is at an all time low. The FED is supposed to protect American dollar valuation instead of devaluing it. There should be a law requiring a base rate of 4% interest when you put your money into savings. However, the FED is substantially devaluing our currency rate which means the taxes U.S. citizens paid in 2.4 trillion in taxes no losing values in the billions of dollars each day. Our currency is being stolen and taken out of this country by foreign governments through commodity swaps. Your taxes will only go up with this present monetary policy, your savings will decrease in valuation, and your 401k's and IRA's will lose substantial value as long as the FED holds off raising the U.S. Interest Rates. Each an every voting member of the FED should be fired and investigated. Their conversations and transcripts with other foreign banking systems should be made public and used to convict them of the intentional devaluation of our currency that Congress has mandated them to protect. The current U.S. Dollar devaluation only serves to harm American citizens, American businesses, and weakens our government. Using our taxes to leverage our currency weaker should be a Federal crime. Until our government and Congress mandate that the FED protect our currency valuation, we can all only expect higher taxes, lower valuations to our savings, and greater control of our government by foreign countries. I say fire each and every voting member of the Federal Reserve and if they are involved in a conspiracy to devalue the U.S. Dollar, then they each should be prosecuted and put in prison. To give a COLA now...they would have to give seniors 7 years of increases at a rate of 3% all at once just to get back to where the dollar value was when they denied seniors the SS COLA.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9853,"user_ideo":0.3647,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.9,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1704},{"user_id":631379000359809,"comment_id":10153592684921749,"date":"2016-01-16","message":"Our awesome President Obama!!

Leslie i don't think you're right. Before you keel over with anger. 1. If a man wore that his balls would hang out - that was where I was going. Just because her vagina doesn't fall out, I still find it indecent. It's an inappropriate garment full stop. It's not a matter of masculine / feminine for me - it's just plain inappropriate. 2. I've no problem with men wearing skirts or make up in public and I know no one who would. I have no issue with fluid gender - my experience across the U.K. is that if you're a nice person, no one cares. (Maybe different in schools!?). Maybe we're more liberal than you guys in the USA. That said if men chose to wear skirts etc, they - like women - have to be a socially acceptable length. That's to say his balls and arse aren't to hanging out. That IS important here. You may call it old fashioned, I call it common decency. 3. Mulan, Disney film for kids. She is referred to as a 'cross dresser'. So no, it's not only applied to men. So I think your anger is a bit misplaced and you've turned a gender less comment on appropriateness of attire into a wider debate on gender....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0027,"user_ideo":-0.3488,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1704},{"comment_id":10153167720753188,"date":"2015-03-19","message":"Congrats to Ben and especially Israel and the Jewish people!
