TED AND HEIDI CRUZ !!!!!SHARE THIS EVERY WHERE !!! TED CRUZ IS THE PREACHER that said( he thinks gays should be killed ) there is a video with Cruz saying this on you tube AND HIS CULT CHURCH agreed with him . !!!!! CRUZ FOLLOWERS are Tricked by his BIG LIES !!!! TRUMP IS A CONSERVATIVE !!!!THE LIBERAL IS CRUZ !!!! HIS FATHER IS CUBAN !!!! HE IS HILLARY IN A MANS BODY !!! HILLARY CLINTON ALSO RECEIVED MONEY FROM GOLDMAN SACKS !!!!, You MUST know these things! Educate yourselves on him and his wife * Heidi Cruz has been employed by Goldman Sachs since 2005. She is currently on leave. * Heidi Cruz is a member of the leftist council on foreign relations, advocates of world Government and a New World Order. * Ted Cruz was George Bush's top policy advisor. * Ted Cruz was in the federal Trade Commission. * Ted and Heidi met when they were both Bush staffers.( BIG LIE ) TEDDY WHOSE REAL NAME IS RAPHAEL and HEIDI ARE BLOOD COUSINS. * Cruz advised on legal affairs and Heidi on economic policy for the bush administration. * Heidi was director for the Western Hemisphere on the national security council under Condoleeza Rice. * Heidi served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative to USTR head, Robert Zoellick, working on China trade policy. * Ted Cruz' campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, is a former CIA officer. He also worked for Goldman Sachs. * Ted Cruz voted for cloture on TPA, (trans pacific partnership agreement) fast track trade authority, removing the hurdle of concern for further amendment, and clearing the way for passage! It didn't have to be recorded, so nobody knew this. He voted NOT to require approval of congress before other countries could join, including China. * Cruz has openly stated that he will NOT use a deportation force, and will continue to use the failed ICE system, where an illegal has to commit a crime first, then be caught. * Cruz belongs to the radical Christian sect of 7 mountains dominionism, that seeks to place their members in control of our culture and create a NWO though the domination of business, government, media, arts & entertainment, education, family, and religion. He is the appointed messiah/savior of their group. * Ted Cruz has only been a citizen for about 19 months! He renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014 so he could run for president. There are also other reasons that he is not constitutionally eligible, including the fact that both of his parents were NOT U.S. Citizens when he was born, only his mother was. Wise up, he's not who you think he is he has always been establishment, he is bought and paid by the banks. He did not vote to audit the Federal Reserve, he most certainly is establishment.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":946},{"comment_id":1082017065151379,"date":"2015-10-06","message":"Yep, they won with an illegal play.
