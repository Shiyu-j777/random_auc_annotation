I found this within ...maybe 10 min. But I know of mind teasers I have worked on for hours when I was in my youth. ... It is the challenge, how many great scientist do you think spend hours and days trying to figure out a problem. Yes this is not like that .... or is it. I remember a brain teaser I worked on for hours using cubes and finally figured it out, that was in my youth. I saw a kid at school trying to figure it out, I told him I could do it. Both he and his friend said I could not do it. They gave me the blocks and I put them together like they should go. The boys friend, took the cubes mixed them up and said ........... NO YOU DIDN'T ...... ... Truly I comment them on spending the time and not giving up. I would hate to give up while trying to figure out the best way to kiss a certain girl. .... if she is willing ..

Great. Then when you show some aggression to a complete stranger you don't know, and he throws something at you, he is reacting to you the same way he would probably react if a male did that, if not worse. So isn't that the point you were trying to advocate for as a feminist ? that they're treating you how they would treat anyone else on the street with that? That doesn't mean his behavior was right. It was childish.
