Do you have a valid point to make? No one has said you're a Trump supporter, but we have pointed out the ludicrous statements you make. It also seems as though you think the 2nd amendment is the only one in the constitution. You know what Scalia did? He opened a can of worms with the ruling on Heller v D.C. and McDonald v Illinois, for it was decided that matters of gun possession are a State problem, and restrictions depend on each state. So you now have a state with one set of rules, and another with no rules; however, you can just go across state lines and buy whatever you want, as long as the selling state has no limits. When Scalia was asked about the consequences this may carry, he said he'll wait until then. This also made it difficult for the loopholes to be eliminated, and anyone who wants a gun, can have it; regardless of whether or not that person should own one. I hope you don't complain or \"\"\"\"pray for victims\"\"\"\", each time an unqualified person to own a gun goes on a shooting rampage.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0012,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":2595},{"user_id":10210469342238391,"comment_id":603479956476023,"date":"2016-06-21","message":"lol man, are you protecting yourself with a hunting rifle from the game?
