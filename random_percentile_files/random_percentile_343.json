The reason is because these cities are quite expensive to live in. With an increase to the taxpayer base for these cities, it's quite economically beneficial for these cities to add illegal immigrants to the current taxpayer base that they already have. These cities are so progressive, they might a well tax themselves into bankruptcy and I am going to be glad when they're crying for a bailout from the federal government. In response to the question about Trump having the potential in cutting of federal funding for sanctuary cities: Oh yes, Trump is definitely going to cut off federal funding for these cities. The more cuts, the better. It's time for these cities to swallow their own pills when they want higher taxes. Taxing their citizenry is not going to help out much. Thank you for the questions.

By then she had to have her leg amputated but the surgeon told the daughter she would die during surgery. He told the daughter that they could administer a lethal dose of morphine and end her suffering. The doctor told the daughter that her mother was a burden and would be better off dead. The daughter asked him if he meant to put her down like a sick animal and he said yes. She told him he better not and he better make sure her mother didn't die.
