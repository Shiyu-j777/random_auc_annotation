Name recognition. Most if not all politicans have website, if they don't they are living in the dark ages. You can check them out on the state and local level to see if their views and policies are similar to yours. If you are looking for change this is the level to start making politicans work for you. A few years ago we had politicians who thought they were above the people. Well the people had a recall election and throw the bums out. Since that recall the politicans work for the town,not themselves or their party affiliation. People have power for change they just need to work together and let politicians know who their boss happens to be, and that's the voters.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1052,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.2,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1014},{"user_id":1262185247138756,"comment_id":597191207138111,"date":"2017-01-20","message":"Lol, yea, ok â „ï¸ , when will people finally realize the government won't fix their problems, they have too, I think you're referencing health care?
