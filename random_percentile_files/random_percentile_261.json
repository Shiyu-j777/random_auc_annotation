My initial impression of Trudeau was when I caught his \"\"\"\"Because it's 2015,\"\"\"\" comments on my normal weekly news recaps. Personally, I'm a firm believer in equal opportunity and equal representation. But forced equal outcome is NOT an ideal solution to anything. There's less women in politics (not because of a lack of opportunity but for a lack of willingness) so, statistically, if you are pulling 50% of a cabinet from a much smaller pool of talent then you are likely passing up better qualified candidates in the other, larger pool of talent. That's literally discrimination and preferential hiring and it's extremely regressive under the guise of progressivism. The next step is to restrict the larger pool's numbers so that it forces less spots to be filled...that's not equal opportunity. I do believe that Trudeau is a highly intelligent person who is qualified to lead. But the rest of the world views him as Tumblr: The Prime Minister in the same way the rest of the world views Trump as Ridiculous Incarnate. At some point, the leader must wade through the bullshit from both sides, objectively see the facts, and make his own decisions. Trudeau, from an outsider's perspective, seems to just be going with pop pseudo science and it's sort of making you guys lose your reputation of being the most friendly and awesome people in the world. Take my input however you'd like...but this is the impression he's giving on the World Stage.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0027,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":261},{"user_id":1228082373879501,"comment_id":10154268726366509,"date":"2015-12-05","message":"@ Dave.
