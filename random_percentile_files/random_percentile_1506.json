Jennifer the person just used that as an example NOT a comparison.. She was just saying no one knows who their child is going to turn out to be when they get here.. Personally I think everyone should be respectful and accepting to everyone within reason, but just because you accept/care for someone doesn't mean you accept all of their choices, and it doesn't mean you don't love them any less because of it. with transgender and homosexual children I'm sure all were aware of the possibility yet didn't expect them to be that way, but they still love them deep down whether or not they agree with their child's sexuality. It doesn't make them bad parents, and AGAIN it doesn't mean they don't love them, or let alone be deemed unworthy to have children! >.> respond to situations differently with good intentions, and some make mistakes thinking they're helping and doing the right thing for their kids when they're not (like Alcorn's parents..)
