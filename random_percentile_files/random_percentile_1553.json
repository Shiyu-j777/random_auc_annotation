But sometimes being a decent human makes you politically correct. Donald Trump, would not be able to be politically correct because he is not a decent human, he has no empathy, he doesn't care if he hurts someones feelings. And to champion his type of behavior is disgusting and a true vision of what the world has become. We lack empathy, we lack common decency, we lack the basic principles that allow us to behave properly in a social environment. My point is there is a difference in political correctness and human decency, Trumps seemingly lack of political correctness is not some campaign for the end of political correctness... its an excuse to be an asshole. You can be truthful to people without being an asshole about it. If not, you're just an asshole.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":0.0193,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1553},{"comment_id":10154156754981491,"date":"2016-11-11","message":"Consider this a donation option...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1428,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.24,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1553},{"user_id":1065480766867304,"comment_id":10153266250836323,"date":"2015-04-24","message":"Whatever! these are their lessons on self love.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3593,"user_ideo":-0.4166,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.43,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1553},{"user_id":10208117568951247,"comment_id":10153577810693010,"date":"2015-08-01","message":"Typical liberal ideology.

You already make two or three times what non-union workers make, even though you lazy jerks don't work nearly as hard. But that's somehow never enough for you. And you have the nerve to call other people greedy! As a truck driver, i absolutely despise when i have to go to a union warehouse or factory. They are ALWAYS incredibly rude and extremely slow.
