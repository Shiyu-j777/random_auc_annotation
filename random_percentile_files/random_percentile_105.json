But that not withstanding we are also having to employ 30,000 civil servants to sort out Brexit. There is no saving whatsoever with Brexit Kathleen. The cost to us as British people will be overwhelming. The NHS is already failing. My daughter-in-law an architect designs NHS hospitals. 4 large new hospitals were shelved in September of this year. It's us that will be paying for the fall in the value of the pound by less services available. Did you realise too that Britain is THE only EU country that keeps immigrants who if after 3 months they do not have a job and are on our benefit system? Do you know why we are the only country in the EU where this is happening? It's because here we pay our workers less per hour than what the EU deems to be acceptable. The British government gets away with it through taxes such as the Working and Child tax credit. These tax breaks are for people on the lowest incomes. In reality we are paying through our taxes to support employers who pay their work force low wages. This doesn't happen in other EU countries. For Britain to be able to send home immigrants who haven't a job after 3 months who are on our Benefit system it would entail a change in the tax law. Cameron would have been afraid to do this as most of his support for the Tory Party comes from employers. In reality what is happening is the British public are paying a good percentage of the wage of low income families. If you think the momentum for Brexit is growing why are you afraid of another vote? I say bring it on. We only voted for in or out we didn't vote on the terms of the treaty. I'm sorry you find my manner offensive. I have never been interested in Politics. In fact this issue is not about politics it's about right and wrong, it's about believing that we are all individuals and no-one is better than anyone else, it's a belief about tolerance and love for fellow human beings whoever they may be.......refugees from war torn Syria or Muslims in Bradford, it's about acceptance and toleration on issues of gender, it's about fair day's pay for a fair day's wage. These are all issues that the EU backed and which our country could wriggle out of. Yes I am single minded. My community in a deprived part of England has benefitted by the EU as have my children who have liv d and worked in other EU countries. I am devastated by this result and that is the reason for my single mindedness. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share with you the reasons I voted Remain.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0013,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":105},{"user_id":1035021213213901,"comment_id":839881386047284,"date":"2015-02-25","message":"Good poster for treason","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5673,"user_ideo":0.8683,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.58,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":105},{"user_id":10208223726728279,"comment_id":10154089140092373,"date":"2017-02-02","message":"Shannon Lampe","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1372,"user_ideo":0.432,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.23,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":105},{"user_id":585656531614235,"comment_id":914899855308570,"date":"2016-11-05","message":"I will help others get their needs before I would help my own family get all their Wants they feel like their owed.

The german Shepherd also looks still really young (probably around 1) and younglings can learn easily but barking is normal in almost every household. Its an attention alert, the dog got out because officer did nudge the door open (which i believe to not be allowed) and the dog got out; if it was aggressive it would've junped straight as it got out of the door; also dogs have a different tone when they are being aggressive and snarl, not wagging their tail, ears fully down and backs raised. This dog was just excited and most dogs are when someone is at the door. So in this case trom the body language and the vocalisation i identified in this video the dog was NOT aggressive or territorial but excited and alert. This is coming from an animal behaviourist who has and is studying animals and worked with all types of dogs.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0608,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":105},{"comment_id":1021722537895609,"date":"2016-05-20","message":"Proposed.
