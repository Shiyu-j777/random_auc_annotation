So, I believe that this report is a carefully contrived attempt to make it appear that blacks are not racist and whites are. What is dispicable is how the hidden divisive media uses an act of kindness to divide this nation further apart.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9717,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.88,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":557},{"comment_id":1674567196119777,"date":"2015-12-31","message":"This man is going through hell for the charges brought up against him, but we can't get justice for the crimes committed by officers Daniel Pantaleo, Tim Loehmann, and Darren WIlson?

Instead, it will use the tribunals in that \"\"\"\"trade agreement\"\"\"\" to demand payment for what it expected it would have earned if it had built and operated the pipeline. Thus, the damages it claims are 15 billion. It will not need to demonstrate that it has standing in any normal sense. And, it will be seeking a judgement not from a U. S. judge, but an arbitrator who is a corporate attorney that can also practice as a litigator for the very corporations on which he/she sits in judgement. Outraged? Even more outrageous is this same provision in the mother of all trade agreements: TTP, now coming up for approval by the U. S. Congress, after it approved Fast Track Authority.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0017,"user_ideo":-0.8491,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":557},{"user_id":1123500131022410,"comment_id":10154369452231336,"date":"2016-06-15","message":"ONly if they settle--but folks wishing they would pay won't want me on the jury if there is any trial!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.254,"user_ideo":0.785,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.34,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":557},{"comment_id":10154599035603987,"date":"2016-09-17","message":"Made millions off Americans afraid to defend them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.933,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.83,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":557},{"user_id":1178328402224624,"comment_id":1508461299173895,"date":"2016-09-22","message":"And Hillary, WORSE OFF?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9294,"user_ideo":0.2198,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.82,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":557},{"comment_id":10154582063498073,"date":"2017-02-14","message":"water board all politicians and send them to the gallows","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8664,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.77,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":557},{"user_id":282203938814718,"comment_id":717281768460114,"date":"2017-02-08","message":"I'm sorry, but if my child there would be a whole bunch of stink going on.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7615,"user_ideo":0.5,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.7,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":557},{"user_id":916382098498905,"comment_id":10154952248276002,"date":"2016-07-23","message":"Just so sad for that family and that dog sitter who must feel awful","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.492,"user_ideo":-0.1174,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.53,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":557},{"user_id":10210467259786572,"comment_id":1107602162626702,"date":"2016-10-12","message":"Need to end for profit medicine and pharmaceuticals.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0474,"user_ideo":-0.7329,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.12,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":557},{"user_id":1072925702756986,"comment_id":1747275765520335,"date":"2016-06-16","message":"Hillary supporting liberal","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9938,"user_ideo":0.3149,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":557},{"comment_id":909912762399203,"date":"2015-02-28","message":"I remember being born","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5643,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.58,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":557},{"user_id":10153630833356020,"comment_id":10153138313971770,"date":"2015-11-21","message":"Maybe this person should drop out and go to a shrink hospital.
