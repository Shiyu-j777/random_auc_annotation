Many of the people railing against him will too. I'm sick and tired of people saying we will have to wait forever to see a doctor, and that old people are going to die. That's not how it works. As someone who is self employed with a pretty serious pre-existing condition, I went without insurance for quite some time until the ACA was passed. I didn't want a handout, just the opportunity to purchase insurance. People bitched about increased premiums, and I'm sorry about that, but they ignore people in my situation. Single-payer will benefit even more people. Americans apparently aren't as empathetic and generous as I had hoped, at least from the nasty comments I've been hearing.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0006,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1131},{"user_id":10205423898156764,"comment_id":1293212120706523,"date":"2016-04-09","message":"MORE OF A REASON TO VOTE Donald J.
