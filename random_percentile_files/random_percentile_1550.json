The bible isn't trail mix where you can pick and choose what you like and don't like and there are some pretty terrible passages written in it by a bunch of men a couple years ago. But I guess that's why they keep revising and omitting things that, over the years and changing times, have been deemed inappropriate, sexist and down right oppressive. Especially when it comes to women and how they should act being basically subservient to their husbands. That part I find ironic when women say they live by the bible but insist they are strong, independent, want equal rights and be treated with respect by men.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0028,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1550},{"user_id":1184548624910294,"comment_id":10153242625741336,"date":"2015-05-10","message":"This is totally ridiculous.
