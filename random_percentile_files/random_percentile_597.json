It certainly broke the regular rules that have been followed for a long time. His brother was Governor of FL and it was an election not won by the American people but by FL political voting.

Overfishing of so many species argues against care for the oceans as being universal, as does the massive amount of netting killing wildlife. Sometimes the question is not whether or not people care, but if they care enough to do the right thing. My sense is that the family farm vs agribusiness analogy works here. Massive nets that sweep up every living thing are not left by small family businesses. And it is also true that some family farms set the standard for humane and environmentally sensitive farming, while other farmers are all about the bottom line and maximizing profits.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0015,"user_ideo":-0.4387,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":597},{"user_id":511344842390878,"comment_id":921736477941898,"date":"2016-01-23","message":"Racist Pricks.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1091,"user_ideo":0.8697,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.2,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":597}]
