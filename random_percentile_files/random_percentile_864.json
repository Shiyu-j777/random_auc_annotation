HANDguns murder half of all murder victims, and over twice as many suicides are by HANDgun. Which is interesting because 1/3 of all US households have a gun, but they're used in a very small number of murders. Only 1/5 of black US households have a gun. And 2/3 of all guns are owned by just 1/5 of gun owners. This means that 2/3 of all guns are owned by 1/15 of Americans. The average gun owner now owns 8 guns here. This means that 8 guns is what the average comes to if they're all distributed evenly among the 1/3 of all gun owners. They are not. It is a very paranoid and idiotic minority of Americans, WELL under 10% of people, who are rabidly against gun control of any kind. OVER 95% of ALL Americans favor VERY stringent Background checks, some limits on gun types, Mental Health checks, practical testing (as with getting drivers license), licensing, registration AND insurance for EVERY FIREARM. It is important to note that the Second Amendment protects being armed but has never been a free-for-all. We aren't allowed to walk around with grenade launchers or SMR tubes on our backs. We're not allowed to walk around with a \"\"\"\"flame thrower.\"\"\"\" So there ARE limits on arms, even in bladed arms. And that's key. Guns are NOT the only arms, and they weren't when the Constitution was written. People carried knives for protection and as a tool. If you have a knife on you, you're armed, and that can be regulated, and is, too. Gun people are insane in this country. Civilians do NOT need handguns. Period. 3/4 of all murders, rapes, assaults, home invasions, burglaries are by people well known to the victims here: Family, Friends, coworkers, teammates, schoolmates, fellow church members, etc. People who carry handguns are protecting themselves against, first and foremost, their families. The solution to gun violence, obviously as shown in the example here of Australia's dramatic drops in murder and gun murder, is NOT more guns. MORE guns is NOT the solution to gun violence!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"user_ideo":-0.1623,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":864},{"user_id":624272287737139,"comment_id":10153024799126519,"date":"2015-07-10","message":"He really needs to speak out on behalf of the downtrodden Greek people who are being brutalized by the financial interests in Europe.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0335,"user_ideo":-0.8471,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.1,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":864},{"user_id":1263788706985109,"comment_id":1581280778830630,"date":"2016-02-29","message":"Oscars are so over.

Here is history and the Facts. Will Egypt's Barack Obama be executed ? Judges have already sentenced to death several other senior figures in the Muslim Brotherhood, including its general guide, Mohammed Badie. However, none have so far been executed. All death sentences have to be sent to the grand mufti, Egypt's highest religious authority, for his opinion on whether they should stand. But even when the grand mufti gives his approval, convictions are still open to appeal. Experts also believe a death sentence for Morsi would be unlikely to be carried out. After all, he is still a Muslim. What's happened to Hosni Mubarak? Mr Mubarak was charged with conspiring in the killing of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 uprising. He was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison in 2012, but the Court of Cassation overturned the conviction and ordered a retrial in 2013. The charge was dropped in November 2014, but in June 2015 a judge accepted an appeal from prosecutors and ordered a retrial. Mr Mubarak is residing in a military hospital in Cairo, where he had previously been detained. CAIRO — An Egyptian judge on Tuesday confirmed a death sentence against the deposed president Mohamed Morsi, condemning his rule as a “black night” and his Islamist movement as “satanic” and “diabolical.” Mr. Morsi’s sentence was among more than 100 handed down last month by the same court after two sweeping mass trials, including dozens of sentences to death or life in prison. It is none of our business who is in power in Egypt, just as it is none of our business if England leaves the horrible nightmare that is the EU. Just like the U.S.S.R. fell the EU should fall.

Iowa Supreme Court upholds ban on felons voting The Iowa Supreme Court ruled 4-3 yesterday against an expansion of voting rights for convicted criminals, The Des Moines Register reports. There are about 56,500 Iowans disqualified from voting due to felony convictions, of which about 7,400 are currently in prison. Besides Iowa, only Florida and Kentucky bar convicted felons from voting unless they receive a restoration of rights from the governor. Tesla’s autopilot probed by government after crash kills driver Federal regulators are investigating Tesla’s autopilot mode following a May 7 crash that killed the driver when the car was hit by a tractor-trailer that turned in front of it, CNN reports. Tesla said the brake didn’t activate because the autopilot system didn’t detect the truck’s white side against a brightly lit sky. Drones are an accident waiting for a place to happen. We do not need Obama's Drone Collateral Damage in the United States. We do not need Drones above our cities, homes, and hospitals. The movie Independence Day: Resurgence opens in theaters today. It’s about an alien invasion. Yesterday, the Supreme Court of the United States blocked Barack Obama’s illegal illegal immigration diktat. Also yesterday, the British people voted to declare today “Independence Day” from the Brussels bureaucrats in order to stop an alien invasion of Europe. We know Barack Obama and our CIA created ISIS as they created the Al Qaeda, with the help of our Senate and House in Washington, DC.
