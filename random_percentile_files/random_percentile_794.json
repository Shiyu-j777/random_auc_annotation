Closing the boarders from unvetedd Muslims is in this countries best interest. Our boarders were closed from the Japanese, Italians, and Germans during WW II... I respect the position of president but not the man in the position. For you to bring up my PATRIOTISM because I wear the same uniform as you is disgraceful. The sanctions against Russia is a farce blind man. You blindly trust a government that has proven time and time again they are untrustworthy. Your mind is so rapped around who did it and not why it was done or how it could of been done. This is what opposing countries do...See how far they can get and expose one another's weaknesses. That's the bigger picture you don't see. Do you think we don't do the same thing to our adversaries? Wake up Gunny... You can't see the forrest through the trees. You gobble up all the B.S. that is fed to you. As for the President goes, are you going to respect the incoming POTUS if he does draw an alliance with Russia or are you going to oppose him? By the way, when is the last time the U.S. and Russia were in opposition during war...?
