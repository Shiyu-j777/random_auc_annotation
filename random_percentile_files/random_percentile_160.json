MARCO RUBIO – “I’m a natural born Citizen because I was born in Florida, to two Cuban citizen parents.” – Which means, according to Rubio, Cruz is NOT a natural born Citizen, because Ted was born in Canada. CRUZ and RUBIO SUPPORTERS – “We are constitutional conservatives who don’t know and don’t care about the Constitution.” REAL CONSTITUTIONALISTS – Cruz and Rubio are BOTH frauds…. Neither is a “natural born Citizen” of the USA eligible for the offices they seek, and their supporters are frauds as well.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.978,"user_ideo":0.6001,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":160},{"user_id":10206167614058042,"comment_id":10154514823981336,"date":"2016-08-10","message":"A vote for Donald J.
