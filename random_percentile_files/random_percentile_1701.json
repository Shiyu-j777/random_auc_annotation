The electoral college works and should never be removed.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7799,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.72,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1701},{"comment_id":10153602278243984,"date":"2015-07-23","message":"I love the ignorance and intellectual dishonesty in that statement.

Our nation is in such distress and unrest and king trump has stirred a hornets nest of racism, fascism, antisemitism, gender discrimination, hatred towards non-Christians, hatred towards immigrants and refugees, bullying and sick, elderly and disabled. Our Nation is ALREADY Great! Why because we the people have formed a more perfect union of huddled masses seeking freedom, equality and grace in a land of the free and home of the brave comprised of both the majority and minority PEOPLE. People are unique and most have many challenges throughout life. We need each other and have a common aim to do unto others as we would have done to us. That Golden rule and the idea that we have a responsibility for ourselves and the least amoung us. The safety net and aid for those in our midst and abroad have created the more perfect union that does shine as a light set on a hillside. We, USA, cannot shirk it's mission and purpose in history to continue to move further upon the road of this perfection and NOT hide the light under the bushel! We have delayed in the past to aid or open our doors to those who knocked under extreme duress (Japanese Americans, Native Americans, Jews in WWII, Bosnians, Hispanics fleeing, Palestinians, Croatians, etc) now we see the fleeing from terror. We cry with the Syrian refugees and those disrupted by war. Instead of spending energy on rejecting them can we not spend our mutual energy on better solutions. When we reject our own immigrants and seek to deport them, we must pay to detain and IMPRISON them for three years, rip away their children from their arms, place these children in foster care or another type of jail, steal their possessions and property! Why are we destroying our future? Is this about GREED like that which possessed the Nazis in WWII to steal the riches (including gold teeth, skin, eye glasses, shoes, clothes, etc) of their victims? Why are we not more creative? We are a nation of innovative and creative people from the great mixing bowl of humans who make this land their own. Think clearly and unlock the gridlock in Congress with a new endeavor for Unity, Tranquility for our grand experiment of INCLUSION not EXCLUSION. Your endeavor to unify Congress across all party lined against all enemies both DOMESTIC and FOREIGN will move our nation further along this journey! Shall we go backward! NO. NO! NO! A resounding NO! We are a land of generous souls from the least to the greatest amoung us. Stop the greed and the consolidation of wealth in the top 1% while the rest are falling backwards. Stop isolating us from each other and the rest of the world. Wake up from your slumber. Lead us out of this morass by joining hands across the party lines. Stop the chaos. Distress is extreme as we watch the richest become richer without caring for those who are reaching up towards them. They turn their nose up and their eyes away as they gaze with love in the eyes of the other rich. They are gluttyons, steal through smiles of corruption, eat cake while the masses are starving! You cannot serve G-d and Mammon. The good Samaritan crossed over the road toward the wounded foreigner while the rich and religious purposefully crossed over to the other side of the road to AVOID aiding their fellow human in distress. Which one will you be? Time to act, time to set a new course! We the People will continue to peacefully protest and take actions to ensure you hear our voices loud and clear. We call on you now! Change course, uphold protect and defend our Constitution and the rule of law! Very respectfully, OUR EYES ARE WIDE OPEN!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1701},{"user_id":10101537211528062,"comment_id":10154333410388822,"date":"2016-12-09","message":"I'm simultaneously disappointed that this doesn't actually exist and angry people thought it did...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0189,"user_ideo":-0.3739,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1701},{"user_id":1485227801490714,"comment_id":1086068591434927,"date":"2016-03-07","message":"Kill them all.Burn them Alive like dog !","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9844,"user_ideo":-0.2847,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.9,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1701},{"user_id":1145070995535133,"comment_id":10154180150978984,"date":"2016-03-15","message":"After the way Cruz thru his loony pos mouthpiece Glenn Beck thrashed voters that weren't on the Canadians band wagon I wouldn't vote for the beady eyed weasel no matter who he was running against !","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9992,"user_ideo":0.8907,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1701},{"user_id":10211452661133248,"comment_id":10154509616384032,"date":"2017-01-31","message":"While I am against illegal immigration, I just felt I needed to weigh in on this.

It's easy to lie when you're hiding behind a fake account. Why do you do that ? Sometimes I wonder if you're a coward, other times I think it just lets you pad the perception of anti vax 'weight of numbers' by using multiple accounts to post here. The fear for their son is very real and very understandable and an ADULT would have to be a bit of a see you en tee to ignore that or minimise that because they are ignorant and anti science. One thing I often notice in anti vaxers is their absolute lack of care or consideration for anyone but themselves, including their own children. It's sad. The claim \"\"\"\"it's not my job to set myself on fire to keep you warm\"\"\"\" is an idiotic premise. It is your job to share your blanket if they are cold and have no blanket of their own. Your attitude is anti community yet here you are not only leeching all the positives of the community, you're using community resources to push your dishonest anti child anti vax agenda. If you won't be a responsible community member you should get out of the community. Off Facebook, off the internet, off the roads, out of the house, out of supermarkets, out of jobs .. go live in a hole in the ground in the forest where your anti community attitude harms no one but you. Unfortunately, the government does need to get heavy handed to address the anti community, anti child attitudes of you and your friends.
