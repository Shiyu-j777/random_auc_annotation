You lost because you stole from America via taxation while telling us that we were the greedy ones. You lost because you dropped more bombs, killed more with drone strikes, and increased tensions with a nuclear superpower all while telling us that we were the war-mongers. You lost because the cities that you controlled spiraled into poverty and crime all while you told us that our policies disenfranchised people. You lost because you told us that gender is simply a social construct all while telling us that Hillary should be president because of her gender. You lost because you support and take money from regimes that imprison or kill gays, subjugate women, and think that rape is a man's right all while telling us that we hate gays, are afraid of women, and promote a culture of rape. You did not lose because we are racist. You did not lose because we are homophobic. You did not lose because we are misogynists or bigots. You lost because you are liars.

I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ¡°sexism¡± to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you¡¯re even worthy of a job? A leader doesn¡¯t need pollsters, a panel of advisors, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn¡¯t shout ¡°what does it matter¡± when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death. If I¡¯m hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don¡¯t care whether you¡¯re a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That¡¯s common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can¡¯t ask; what verbiage is acceptable?
