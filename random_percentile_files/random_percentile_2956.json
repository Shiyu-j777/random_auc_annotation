And there is a sense of common purpose on the neighborhood level, and in the school, and in the workplace. That dissipates the further up it goes because all the money, because all the filters, and all the polarizing that takes place in terms of how our politics is shaped. But the only way to prevent that is by people getting involved. And it doesn’t take that much. I guarantee you if people feel strongly about making sure that Iran doesn’t get a nuclear weapon without us going to war, and that is expressed to Congress then people would believe in that. And the same is true on every single issue. If people are engaged, eventually the political system responds despite the money, despite the lobbyists.
