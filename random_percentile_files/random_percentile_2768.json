I think Trump really is trying to help all Americans. Just listen to his supporters who know him best, they have nothing but kind words to say about him and his children. He might not be the most polished but who wants that? I'm sick and tired of the polished politician! All they say is what they think you want to hear but never act on it. Those words he used are offensive but if you think back you have probably said things you regret yet no one has come forward saying he has ever touch them or done things to woman in the way Bill Clinton has! Donald Trump may have said inappropriate things but Bill Clinton has physically done these things and yet Hillary not only stayed with him she also supported that lying nasty sleazy no good sorry excuse for man with no sham. SHAME on you Hillary Clinton! You are a disgrace to all women!
