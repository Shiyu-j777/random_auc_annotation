One of those things being the oh so taboo practice of profiling. Because die hard libtards and social justice warriors don't want to offend. See something say something, another joke. Because many Americans have been sold this horseshit about \"\"\"\"offending\"\"\"\" they don't open their mouths. Don't tell me what I know about DHS the law or the Military. In any event ,to all the other insane people posting here,I'm not calling the POTUS an actual dictator so relax. However he definitely has the vibe. And when it's more imperative to bring in refugees than lets say the crisis in Flint and the crisis with homeless people including veterans , we've got a problem. And you're wrong ,the high deportation figures are misleading. Much of the deportation data was manipulated. But you should know this.
