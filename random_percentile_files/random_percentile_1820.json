Billy Clinton appointed George Tenet to the CIA and Tenet is a devout Democrat and was a disgruntled employee who was caught cooking the books at the CIA and it was his information about WMD's that he gave to Colin Powell that was either a lie or just plain wrong and the only two people that have apologized for Iraq has been Condi Rice and President Bush and we have heard zilch from Colin Powell other than helping his boy Obama out by blaming President Bush and we will never hear an apology from a democrat especially Tenet. As for President Bush's apology, he apologized for getting it wrong but he refuses and should not have to apology for protecting the USA from terrorism and further terrorist attacks and for getting rid of a heinous dictator. In addition, WMDs did exist and I will reiterate what I always say because I have heard the same thing from Iraqis from Mosul, from Baghdad, and from Basra that if Hussein could drain the Tigress and Euphrates Rivers and swamps in Iraq, he could hide WMDs and those same people watched their loved ones be exterminated by WMDs and they also watched or were forced to help transport those WMDs over the Iraqi border into Syria and those stories were told to me a decade ago before the Syrian conflict. As for Trump, if you dislike Obama well imagine a country with Trump as leader--not much difference. And even though 9/11/01 happened 8 months after President Bush took office, the planning and plotting of this attack was taking place during Trump's buddy Bill Clinton's (who Trump also supported) presidency when the terrorists were here on expired VISAs and learning to fly planes with expired VISAs. Trump also proved last night that he will only start wars and send our men and women into war not to protect this country but for financial reasons and financial gains to help his pocket because those reasons came from his own mouth and words.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9802,"user_ideo":0.8422,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1820},{"comment_id":10156986993145354,"date":"2016-04-03","message":"As a Christian, I can say that I believe prostitution is wrong. And I do not think any parent of any little girl-regardless of their beliefs-will say that they want this for their daughter. But prostitution has always been here, and there is no way to stop it. I humbly believe that if these young women had legal protection, their live would be safer. I do not believe this would result in more women-or young men-practicing prostitution, but I do believe that venereal disease could be controlled and the horrible abuses that pimps do on prositutes could be stopped because the women have recourse to legal protection. There is no one that will seriously argue that prostitution will stop. And no good man will patronize prostitutes. But isn't it right to provide some protection of the law for them? Are they less human, less likely to be abused? I think more likely!! It is simply being humane.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5832,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.59,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1820},{"comment_id":10153860131987217,"date":"2016-08-24","message":"The leader that care for his peoples","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9489,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.85,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1820},{"comment_id":1730420260550558,"date":"2016-06-12","message":"Poor comparison....
