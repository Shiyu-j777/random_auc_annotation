You already make two or three times what non-union workers make, even though you lazy jerks don't work nearly as hard. But that's somehow never enough for you. And you have the nerve to call other people greedy! As a truck driver, i absolutely despise when i have to go to a union warehouse or factory. They are ALWAYS incredibly rude and extremely slow. It's very common for me to spend an entire day there, because they take their own sweet time. No sense in working hard when you're guaranteed a ridiculously high wage regardless of how hard you work.
