Too many christians focusing on the love, mercy and grace of Christ and not on the rebuke and truth of Gods word. Rebuking is also in the love of Christ and Christ rebuked and guided a lot! To many christians being led by a wrong way of love. Love is an action and Christ showed us that love by His death and resurrection. During His time on earth Christ did not sin and He rebuked sinners and healed them. He told them about Gid and clearly represented His father in a description of marriage He gave in Matt 19.v3. We can love people but we are not a slave to their way of life just because a law has been brought in by man. God told us to obey His commandments this has now been twisted by man. You can by Law murder babies in the womb does that make it right. Stop asking these christians to be hypocrites because hypocrisy is not love.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9988,"user_ideo":0.6626,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.96,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1920},{"comment_id":10152945282556336,"date":"2015-02-04","message":"number 1 rated cable news 15 years in a row","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7399,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.69,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1920},{"user_id":338630403150462,"comment_id":874872586036651,"date":"2016-11-02","message":"This kind of funny because for, has been known as a Republican station for years","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2718,"user_ideo":0.1134,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.36,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1920},{"comment_id":849502495135952,"date":"2015-07-25","message":"We need more preachers like John Piper!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8053,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.73,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":1920},{"user_id":1331785370166817,"comment_id":10154729673107908,"date":"2016-04-14","message":"Bernie Sanders becoming the president of the United States will be one of the best things ever to happen to this country.
