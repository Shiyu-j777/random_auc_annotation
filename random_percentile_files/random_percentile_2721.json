OK. First of all you say that she will give tax relief to small businesses when you admit she has not released her plan. BTW let's not forget the Tax Policy Center is a liberal organization. As for her constituents they do support increasing taxes for small business, Take Kansas for example, our Governor gave a tax break, Democrats want them to pay taxes no relief. So I highly doubt she will give tax relief to small businesses. Second, you use the EPA statement as evidence saying that consumer bills will reduce. Sorry but it's an EPA plan and that doesnt suffice as independent. Third he said lose full time jobs that could mean as you said reduction of hours because they are no longer full time jobs. Fourth, actually Hillary did say she would raise taxes on the middle class. Let's use snopes, the liberal's favorite fact checker, !.
