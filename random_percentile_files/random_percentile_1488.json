This is a stupidity issue that is being projected as a race issue. All of which could be avoided by obeying what an officer tells you to do and cooperating. Statistically more whites than blacks are killed by cops. And statistically more blacks are killed by BLACKS.

When 13% of the country has the same amount of homicides as the 63% majority, that's bad. You have got to listen to me and trust me. I'm telling the truth. I'm not lying to you like the democrats and other liberals and even those pimps Sharpton and Jackson. The offender and victimization rate in the black community is astronomical compared to any other race. The people comparing white on white crime are ignoring the fact that white America is the 63% majority. If any race has the same amount of murders as the 63%, there's something seriously wrong. That means that the minority is killing a disproportionate amount of people in order to make the numbers equal.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9939,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1488},{"user_id":10154517769733959,"comment_id":10153014649856336,"date":"2015-02-26","message":"It is time to stand up for what we believe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9312,"user_ideo":0.8523,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.83,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1488},{"user_id":10207184909596197,"comment_id":1122671321162452,"date":"2016-02-27","message":"The worst pain everðŸ‘Ž","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3903,"user_ideo":-0.626,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.45,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1488},{"user_id":1135311263252125,"comment_id":10153021825855950,"date":"2015-07-30","message":"Julia take off the tin foil:","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0595,"user_ideo":0.0286,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1488},{"user_id":1104465959674377,"comment_id":10153989118147293,"date":"2016-07-25","message":"who is qualified? Trump? He sure isn't. And yup all those things Michael are at stake! That's why I'm worried Clinton supported the no child left behind in the early 2000s and then discredited it when she ran on 2008, discredited foreign deals like the Colombian free trade deal and then supported it again when she ran in 2008, was opposed to same sex marriage for the longest time and surprise surprise now she supports it, stated that in the future we were going to depend mostly on oil then she said we should look at Iraq as a business opportunity because of their oil which makes me think that's why she voted for the war, and we all know what happened with the whole email deal so I shouldn't have to mention it... Is not that I don't believe democrats have a better idea of how to run office, my problem is with her... She might be saying something today but we are not so sure what she will say tomorrow.
