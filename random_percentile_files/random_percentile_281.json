Not a creature was working, not even their spouse. No stockings were hung by the chimney with care, because they were hoping a Hillary Victory would soon be there. The Hillary voters were nestled all snug in their beds, While continued visions of free cell phones danced in their heads. And mamma with her free healthcare, and unemployment benefits with no cap, Had just settled down for another free winter's nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, They sprang from their beds to see what was the matter. Away to the TV they flew like a flash, Flipped on CNN hoping for more free cash. Trump Won, please, say it aint so Hillary didn’t shatter the glass ceiling, oh no, When, what to their wondering eyes should appear, But a sign from Trump, they have to get a job next year, With one election, so inspiring and quick, America took away their Misses Saint Nick. No more huge taxes for the working and spending pretty much insane, and they began whistling and shouting and calling people names; \"\"\"\"Now, Hillary! Now, Obama! Now, Franken and Reid! On, Pelosi! On Feinstein! On, Baucus and Biden! Out of Washington! We’re building a wall! Get the heck out of here, we just fired you all.

So you're going to boycott Target and have to shop somewhere else to buy your goods? Have you looked into the company's history on other major issues? Some of these other chain stores discriminate against women, minorities, etc. All I'm saying is before you stop spending your money at one store and take your business elsewhere, do your homework.
