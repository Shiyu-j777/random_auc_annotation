It doesn't make them bad parents, and AGAIN it doesn't mean they don't love them, or let alone be deemed unworthy to have children! >.> respond to situations differently with good intentions, and some make mistakes thinking they're helping and doing the right thing for their kids when they're not (like Alcorn's parents..)
