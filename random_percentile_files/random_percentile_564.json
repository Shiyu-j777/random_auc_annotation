Although she has always worked, willing to do jobs others hated (long hours /lower pay scales) as well as when she got offered more prestigious work and is now on 2nd degree doing nurses training. I totally agree with ESA, and it was a really good incentive to get youngsters to continue education (sad it stopped) - I also think its dreadful that intelligent young people get lumbered with crippling debts from uni (me too as I went as an adult into uni) Yes things are changing. I dispute none of what you say. Simply wanted to make people aware that those of us born in the late 50's or earlier did indeed contribute for over 4.5 decades. This new phenomenon in the uk of let's target people as 'unworthy' (be they pensioners, unemployed, disabled, sick, refugees, immigrants etc etc etc) simply does not take into account two things. 1. The vast majority of those targeted have/do/or did, at some point contribute to society. 2. We all could fall on tough times, we all get old and many will lose job, today's changing world offers no surety (especially post Brexit).
