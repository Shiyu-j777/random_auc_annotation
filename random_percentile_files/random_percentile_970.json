I think one of the best things we can do to help Bernie is to get Elizabeth Warren's endorsement. Most Americans trust her and her values mesh well with yours, mine, theirs and Bernie's. Signing this petition, and getting as many of your friends as possible to do it as well could well help it to go viral and become a catalyst to get her to come on board.

(By the way, MOST of the following articles are commentaries by LEFT-wing, progressives.) \"\"\"\"The Bureau of Investigative Journalism in Britain has estimated that, in the first three years after President Obama took office, between 282 and 535 civilians were credibly reported killed by drone strikes â€” including more than 60 children.\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"Weâ€re looking right now at a reality that President Obama has essentially extended the very [drone war] policies that many of his supporters once opposed under President Bush,\"\"\"\" says Scahill.\"\"\"\" Obama to boost US military in Iraq Obama Has Bombed Twice as Many Countries as Bush To Defend Iran Deal, Obama Boasts that He's Bombed Seven Countries U.S. Dropped 23,144 Bombs on Muslim-Majority Countries in 2015 Nearly 90 Percent Of People Killed In Recent Drone Strikes Were Not The Target Are Obama's Record Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt and Iraq Fueling Unrest in Middle East? â€œWe are joined by William Hartung, who says that even after adjusting for inflation, \"\"\"\"the volume of major deals concluded by the Obama administration in its first five years exceeds the amount approved by the Bush administration in its full eight years in office by nearly $30 billion. That also means that the Obama administration has approved more arms sales than any U.S. administration since World War II.\"\"\"\" Former Drone Operators Say They Were â€œHorrifiedâ€ By Cruelty of Assassination Program Obama Backs Biggest Nuclear Arms Buildup Since Cold War Donald Trump and other conservatives' deportation fantasies are awful. President Obama's actual record is even worse. â€œObamaâ€s government has deported more than 2.5 million peopleâ€”up 23% from the George W. Bush years. More shockingly, Obama is now on pace to deport more people than the sum of all 19 presidents who governed the United States from 1892-2000, according to government data.â€ Obama's War on medical marijuana \"\"\"\"But over the past year, the Obama administration has quietly unleashed a multi-agency crackdown on medical cannabis that goes far beyond anything undertaken by George W. Bush.\"\"\"\" New Report Finds Obama Spends $180K Per Day Undermining State Medical Marijuana Laws â€œ\"\"\"\"What's the Cost?\"\"\"\" confirms how much the U.S. Justice Department has spent over three presidential administrations to investigate, raid, arrest, prosecute, and imprison hundreds of medical cannabis patients and their providers â€” nearly half a billion dollars. Far outspending all of his predecessors, the report reveals that President Obama has dedicated nearly $300 million to such enforcement efforts, despite his repeated pledges to not use Justice Department funds in this way.â€ â€œClinton's successor, President Barack Obama, has spent more taxpayer money fighting medical marijuana than former President George W. Bush did during his two terms, according to a June 2013 report released by the pro-medical marijuana group Americans For Safe Access. In August, the White House announced Obama does not support changes to the legal classification of marijuana, despite growing evidence of its medical benefits.â€ Obama Administration suing to keep Black people in prison â€œLast month, President Obama quietly did something that should shake every American to the core. Seeking to enforce federal crack cocaine laws that have since been repealed, the Obama administration asked a federal appeals court to ensure that thousands of human beings, mostly poor and mostly black, remain locked in prison â€” even though everyone agrees that there is no justification for them to be there.â€ Obama's War on whistleblowers Obama Administration Fights To Withhold Over 2,000 Photos Of Alleged U.S. Torture and Abuse Obama Wants to Spend a Trillion Dollars on New Nuclear Weapons The White House Has Been Covering Up the Presidencyâ€s Role in Torture for Years Obama's War on civil liberties Noam Chomsky: Obama's Attack on Civil Liberties Has Gone Way Beyond Imagination Obama is Bad on Civil Liberties, But That Shouldn't Surprise Anyone â€œObama voted for the 2008 FISA amendments, a position that outraged liberals at the time. He continued the Bush-era surveillance of communications networks. He ramped up the war in Afghanistan. He vastly increased drone use overseas. He's declared a war on leakers. He participated in the assault on Libya. He's approved the assassination of American citizens abroad. His DOJ has aggressively made use of the state secrets privilege. He's fought relentlessly to block lawsuits challenging privacy violations and presidential abuses.â€ Obama administration asks Supreme Court to allow warrantless cellphone searches Obama Has Already Broken His Pledge on Surveillance Reform Obama protects Wall Street bankers from going to jail Obama still hasn't closed Gitmo Obama promised to close GuantÃ¡namo.
