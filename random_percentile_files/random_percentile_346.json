HEAR THESE WORDS! ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ HAGGAI 2:6-7 : FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD OF HOSTS; Yet once, it is a little while, and I will SHAKE THE heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land; And I will shake all nations. And the desire of all nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of Hosts. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HEBREWS 12:26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REVELATIONS 10:7 But in the days of the voice of the 7th angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he has declared to his profits the servants. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REVELATIONS 11:15-19 The Seventh Trumpet 15 The seventh angel sounded his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will reign for ever and ever.” 16 And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, 17 saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. 18 The nations were angry, and your wrath has come. The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small— and for destroying those who destroy the earth.” 19 Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant. And there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an EARTHQUAKE and a severe hailstorm. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- REVELATIONS 16:17-21 17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, “It is done!” 18 Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a SEVERE EARTHQUAKE. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since mankind has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. 19 The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath. 20 Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found. 21 From the sky huge hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds,[a] fell on people. And they cursed God on account of the plague of hail, because the plague was so terrible. #THINGSTOCOME #HEWHOHASEARSLETTHEMHEAR #THEGREATEARTHQUAKEISNEXTTHENHAILFROMHEAVEN #SAVEYOURSOULSFORNOMANKNOWETHTHEHOURBUTGOD","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9874,"user_ideo":0.4498,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.91,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":346},{"comment_id":626687334155485,"date":"2016-08-04","message":"Go back to your homeland parasites","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9926,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.92,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":346},{"comment_id":10153423103001717,"date":"2016-03-28","message":"If she wasn't making jokes at survivors expense, which I highly doubt since she's a survivor, then this wasn't a \"\"\"\"political correctness\"\"\"\" issue.

I think Trump really is trying to help all Americans. Just listen to his supporters who know him best, they have nothing but kind words to say about him and his children. He might not be the most polished but who wants that? I'm sick and tired of the polished politician! All they say is what they think you want to hear but never act on it. Those words he used are offensive but if you think back you have probably said things you regret yet no one has come forward saying he has ever touch them or done things to woman in the way Bill Clinton has! Donald Trump may have said inappropriate things but Bill Clinton has physically done these things and yet Hillary not only stayed with him she also supported that lying nasty sleazy no good sorry excuse for man with no sham.
