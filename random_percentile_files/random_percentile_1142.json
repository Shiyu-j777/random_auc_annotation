It's easy to lie when you're hiding behind a fake account. Why do you do that ? Sometimes I wonder if you're a coward, other times I think it just lets you pad the perception of anti vax 'weight of numbers' by using multiple accounts to post here. The fear for their son is very real and very understandable and an ADULT would have to be a bit of a see you en tee to ignore that or minimise that because they are ignorant and anti science. One thing I often notice in anti vaxers is their absolute lack of care or consideration for anyone but themselves, including their own children. It's sad. The claim \"\"\"\"it's not my job to set myself on fire to keep you warm\"\"\"\" is an idiotic premise. It is your job to share your blanket if they are cold and have no blanket of their own. Your attitude is anti community yet here you are not only leeching all the positives of the community, you're using community resources to push your dishonest anti child anti vax agenda. If you won't be a responsible community member you should get out of the community. Off Facebook, off the internet, off the roads, out of the house, out of supermarkets, out of jobs .. go live in a hole in the ground in the forest where your anti community attitude harms no one but you. Unfortunately, the government does need to get heavy handed to address the anti community, anti child attitudes of you and your friends. I don't support mandatory vaccination but I WILL vote for it if it comes to that because quite franky, I don't like you.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0029,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":1142},{"user_id":1653547708199329,"comment_id":10153783122321636,"date":"2016-07-07","message":"Since you (Blair & Bush) think it was better to remove Saddam, and since you took decision for & on behalf of UK & US, now UK & US are bound to concede to consequences of such decision and must accept as many refugees intend to enter into UK & US.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0106,"user_ideo":-0.2795,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.06,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":1142}]
