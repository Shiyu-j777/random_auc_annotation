Kenneth, forgive me for expecting you to think like an investigator. There is no doubt that this is an act of terrorism. Radicalized Islam are willing to give their life freely, which is why they normally commit suicide. This man tried to buy a body armor, which means he planned on coming out of this alive. Next, the killer tried to become a police officer and had friends that were in the police department. Unless the terrorist that he associates with are in the police department, it is unlikely that was associating with terrorist. In addition, we don't know how many people he killed. Three police officers are on leave, chances are the officers are responsible for some of the people killed or wounded. Islam groups have not taken credit, their supporters are praising the attack (you can find that here) My point is let's wait for all the facts to come in before we draw conclusions. Terrorism is associated with politics. How do we know that the motive is not political? Again, let's watch and wait as the facts come in, in the meantime, empathize with the families that lost their loved ones.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1091,"user_ideo":-0.2646,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.2,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1325},{"user_id":1197885870266334,"comment_id":10154317826053145,"date":"2016-10-12","message":"What a sweetheart her grandson must be!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5581,"user_ideo":-0.1535,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.57,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1325},{"comment_id":10154650161446037,"date":"2016-09-14","message":"The word \"\"\"\"bae\"\"\"\" means \"\"\"\"poop\"\"\"\".
