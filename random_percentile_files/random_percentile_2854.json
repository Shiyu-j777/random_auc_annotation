The german Shepherd also looks still really young (probably around 1) and younglings can learn easily but barking is normal in almost every household. Its an attention alert, the dog got out because officer did nudge the door open (which i believe to not be allowed) and the dog got out; if it was aggressive it would've junped straight as it got out of the door; also dogs have a different tone when they are being aggressive and snarl, not wagging their tail, ears fully down and backs raised. This dog was just excited and most dogs are when someone is at the door. So in this case trom the body language and the vocalisation i identified in this video the dog was NOT aggressive or territorial but excited and alert. This is coming from an animal behaviourist who has and is studying animals and worked with all types of dogs.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0608,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":2854},{"comment_id":1291210144235364,"date":"2016-11-09","message":"This cracks me up because they say he has no experience on the world stage and that our troops will not be safe with Trump as Commander in Chief. Does anybody remember that obababa had zero experience when he was elected in 08? That's when our troops really were not safe and America became a breeding ground for lawlessness and illegal immigration. Libertard media just won't stop.
