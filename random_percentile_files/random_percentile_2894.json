This is how they get themselves into trouble with the general public. They are right, Obama is on his way out. But to do this, just to stick it to him one last time, is short term thinking in that, long after Obama is gone, the people will remember this and it will affect your political career. Just have a hearing then say no. At least you will be doing it the right way and not this obstructionist version of what you think is right. Career still has a future, obamas nominee will be dealt with, and we can see who the next president picks.
