Me: middle class, 62, 1 knee replacement,1 going, 2 kids. Got a quote earlier in the year were I to retire $2000 a month...you heard me 2 grand a month. It would be more then my social security benefit. Now they say it's going up by double digits. $2400?, $2600, $2800... Does it matter? It simply isn't feasible. So we are like many and the many that will soon discover they can't retire. We are health insurance slaves - we work to fund other people health insurance. (The premiums are high to fund those who can't or won't pay) We lost our Doctor, it is more expensive it is a disaster... You lied. College slavery? Now she wants us to pay for college for other people as well. Are you kidding?

The media has an interest in the progressive socialist movement, so they try to cover up the horrible past of the Democrat party by saying they \"\"\"\"switched\"\"\"\" sides in the past. The Republican party was founded in 1854 by anti slave activists. The Republican party offered a home to the women's suffrage movement. The Republicans in congress started work on JFK's call for the civil rights act. LBJ, under pressure, asked congress to speed a bill a long, so some Democrats jumped on board to get a bill passed. Democrats are the party of the KKK, Jim Crow, Japanese internment camps, etc. The attempt to rewrite history fails when you study it.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.999,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1505},{"user_id":10208662537194091,"comment_id":10156000748779062,"date":"2017-02-20","message":"Abbott Patrick Paxton must go!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0176,"user_ideo":-0.419,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1505},{"user_id":1786370888298927,"comment_id":10154056060517619,"date":"2015-03-09","message":"Palestine is Judea and Samaria.it belong to Israel that GOD gave to Abrahams decendants,Jacobs.whome GOD called ISRAEL...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9978,"user_ideo":0.4139,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.95,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1505},{"comment_id":10153415662461336,"date":"2015-07-01","message":"Another fact is, most FOX fans throw \"\"\"\"communist\"\"\"\" around just like they throw \"\"\"\"liberal\"\"\"\" around and have no idea what it means.
