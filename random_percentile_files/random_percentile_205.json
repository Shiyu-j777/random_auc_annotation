Not likely. Also, there are many factors at play when determining your speed. I'm only talking about the theoretical maximum for the line itself. And yes modulation scheme is one of those factors. Keep in mind that Internet traffic isn't the only thing being carried by the coax lines. TV transmission talked up a lot of the bandwidth for coax lines. Yes, the signals are segregated but in an overall sense, if half of the bandwidth of a coax line is dedicated to tv, then you've already dropped that 3-4 Gbps down to 1.5-2 Gbps. Factor in users on a segment, the aging condition of the majority of the lines in place and you aren't going to get that 1Gbps speed. And exactly how would you \"\"\"\"halve the distance\"\"\"\"? Unless you are looking at moving into a place that is right next to the provider node, your TX distance isn't something that you have control over. And if you are looking at doubling the modulation scheme, you'd better have that TX power problem solved, otherwise, you aren't going to get your improved signal to the home at the power levels needed to provide the increased speed. At any rate, the solutions you stated might work but it's going to take a hell of a lot more than just replacing a modem to make it work.
