The Old Testament is there to show how impossible it is to achieve perfection. In fact it's put in place so ppl like you will fail it's to show how hopeless we are. There is an old covenant and a new a old law and a new. There was no change now we have the blood of the only one able to fufil the humanly impossible law and covenant which is why we are no longer under the old law but grace. You say well it he changed then! Nope because those who refuse the blood of Christ will be judged according to the old law.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9577,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.86,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":815},{"comment_id":10153386227802093,"date":"2016-03-17","message":"Uh-o!

I'm actually glad I read this post it has help to get this day off to a good start. I just want to say I am not religious, I grew up Christian , but this country should not be based on the values of any church . While I agree with you that tax loopholes for the rich should be eliminated and that campaign finance needs a crucial overhaul. I have to disagree with your gun and health care points. Foods like grapes and hot dogs kill up to 77 children a year do we get rid of those also. Or do we educate people on how those inanimate objects should be handled around children. And on health care, the system itself should have been more regulated not everyone being forced to get covered. I installed cable in houses for a while and you would be shocked to see some of the things that people who claim not to have money for healthcare have.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0238,"user_ideo":-0.3243,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.08,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":815},{"comment_id":846501635462575,"date":"2016-01-20","message":"Matt Leake lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1515,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.25,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":815},{"user_id":10207105138963970,"comment_id":10153407668996336,"date":"2015-06-29","message":"The US SUPREMES COURT needs to stay out of everyone's business !!!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9831,"user_ideo":0.686,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.9,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":815},{"comment_id":1113679555344409,"date":"2016-07-11","message":"Did you mean \"\"\"\"Pass the suck?\"\"\"\" Like Hillary's \"\"\"\"Old Man\"\"\"\" did with Monica??
