WE have to fix this. Just being enraged online isnâ€t enough. We HAVE to get off our asses and DO something. Beliefs mean nothing when you do not act on them. Demonstrations, protests, and charity donations are imperative, right now. For charity, you donate what you can to a cause that will fix the things you want fixed. Even $1 helps an incredible amount. The point is youâ€re DOING something. People donâ€t want to protest because they miss work and school days. Weâ€re no longer living in a time where youâ€re gonna be 100% comfortable. You HAVE to take time out of your hobbies to LEAVE your house and STAND with everyone else. You HAVE to make signs and rally. You HAVE to be part of the crowd. If YOU do not do this, your outrage means NOTHING. You yelled at everyone for changing their profile pictures to flags, saying it does nothing to help people, and you were correct. Weâ€re all aware of whatâ€s happening in Syria, with the North Dakota pipeline, with Brexit, with Trump. We have to DO something to fix it NOW. We do not get to rely on other people, WE have to DO something, and if we donâ€t, the downfall of all of these terrible situations is ONLY our fault. â€œI always wondered why somebody doesn't do something about that.
