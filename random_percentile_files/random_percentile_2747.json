There is so much political issues on racism these days. And I get it! These boys are doing an awesome thing! And I myself don't want them or any other race to think all other races are against them! With the world as it is, we all need to know we are lived and appreciated NO MATTER WHAT!!! I'm sorry if my comment offended you, but we as THE HUMAN RACE, should start showing a little more appreciation for THE HUMAN RACE instead of diversity. Just wanted them to know I appreciate them and what they are doing and that WE AS ANY COLOR ARE NOT AGAINST THEM FOR THEIR COLOR! These are good boys doing a good thing and I thank them! More kids should be out doing the same! I have no intentions on getting into a heated discussion w/ you or anyone else!

Leslie i don't think you're right. Before you keel over with anger. 1. If a man wore that his balls would hang out - that was where I was going. Just because her vagina doesn't fall out, I still find it indecent. It's an inappropriate garment full stop. It's not a matter of masculine / feminine for me - it's just plain inappropriate. 2. I've no problem with men wearing skirts or make up in public and I know no one who would. I have no issue with fluid gender - my experience across the U.K. is that if you're a nice person, no one cares. (Maybe different in schools!?). Maybe we're more liberal than you guys in the USA. That said if men chose to wear skirts etc, they - like women - have to be a socially acceptable length. That's to say his balls and arse aren't to hanging out. That IS important here. You may call it old fashioned, I call it common decency. 3. Mulan, Disney film for kids. She is referred to as a 'cross dresser'. So no, it's not only applied to men.
