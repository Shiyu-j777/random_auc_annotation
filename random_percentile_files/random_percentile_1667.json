Soon we doubters were derided and called anti-American.If you were not pro war with no proof you were on the side of terrorists.Everyday the words would shift,one day we should attack the people due to 911,they hate us for our freedoms,next time they told us our bombs would be welcomed,we would be saving the Iraqis,next day something else.When Bush spoke of tyrants and tyranny,he was describing himself.People were growing hysterical and the media acted as a tool for the greedy war mongers.Yet no proof of wmds. Soon people,cowards, couldn't get us to war fast enough.Never with proof of anything.Our young enthusiastically and naively signed on,to kill those Iraqi 'terrorists,not caring that 911 was not due to Iraq.All the change that came about in the minds of the masses with no proof.Look at the destruction on grand scale, globally accomplished during that corrupt and greedy regime.It continues on.That is how the (anti) Patriot act passed.Fear,fear,fear.I see once again the anger towards persons who dare question.Don't question or you are falsely accused of being pro-Trump,pro-Putin. Don't want to be unAmerkin,now do we. Just a trace of proof? Otherwise it is more fear and anger based propaganda.Works well.And the DNC diverted attention from their dirty work.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0157,"user_ideo":-0.7672,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1667},{"user_id":10206989086061795,"comment_id":10154043022481350,"date":"2016-03-11","message":"Go Oprah!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0422,"user_ideo":-0.1803,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.11,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1667},{"user_id":10210358628907133,"comment_id":10158103490825354,"date":"2016-11-18","message":"If you are not with us your against us.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9153,"user_ideo":0.7471,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.81,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1667},{"comment_id":10153756407051813,"date":"2016-09-27","message":"That is the way they do it!

DOW is at record level. Canada and Mexico have announced they are willing to renegotiate NAFTA with the US. It's only been two days.......Bless those who put Trump in office.Small groups of people have been marched the streets of American cities to protest the results of a free and fair election. The scene on college campuses around America has been even more absurd with students staging \"\"\"\"cry-ins\"\"\"\" and demanding that classes be postponed so they have time to grieve. It's all so thoroughly embarrassing. And I say that especially as a member of this generation. What we're witnessing are nothing more than massive, organized temper tantrums. And that's the nicest way to put it. If thousands of white conservatives had marched in protest of Obama's election, I have no doubt that the media would paint it as a violent, racist insurrection. I won't go that far in this case, but it is a troubling display all the same. The protesters insist that Trump is \"\"\"\"not their president\"\"\"\" and he's \"\"\"\"got to go\"\"\"\" because he's a racist bigot and so are his supporters. But here's the newsflash for these confused young people: He IS your president. And no, he doesn't \"\"\"\"have to go.\"\"\"\" He won the election. It's over. That's how this works. The irony here is that Democrat voter turnout was down significantly this year. Hillary will finish with about 7 million fewer votes than Obama. Trump will finish with fewer votes than any Republican presidential candidate in the last 20 years. What that means is that, most likely, if these kids had mobilized like this a day earlier, they very likely would have won the election. Instead, many of them stayed home and waited until they lost to suddenly decide that they can't tolerate the notion of a Trump presidency. Lazy and entitled. Fulfilling every negative stereotype of my generation. What this really comes down to is that Millennials -- most of them anyway -- just lost a presidential election for the first time. And they can't handle it. And this is the result. And it's truly embarrassing:","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9936,"user_ideo":0.0445,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1667},{"user_id":949105125198103,"comment_id":10153657131439614,"date":"2015-09-03","message":"I pray for their fast recovery.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7057,"user_ideo":-0.227,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.67,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1667},{"user_id":10154106712279069,"comment_id":10150817375734963,"date":"2016-12-28","message":"Dave, I do find it funny that you and Kerri use the exact tactics you claim to hate about Trump.
