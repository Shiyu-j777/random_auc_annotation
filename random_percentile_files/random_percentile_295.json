He says he wants to bring jobs back to the USA because currently it's to expensive for large companies to produce their product here. Why would he or his daughter pay more here when they can get it cheaper somewhere else. When he's president he's going to bring the large companies back and creat more jobs here because under this current administration it's too expensive. I challenge anyone that drives an American brand car ford, Chevy or dodge just to name a few and actually look to see where some of the parts actually come from.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9811,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":295},{"comment_id":10155812417015093,"date":"2015-06-26","message":"They weren't meddling in politics.

We need people working in this country and off the rolls. The Republicans are in favor of the pipeline therefore it is going to be automatically rejected by Obama. Also he does not want people off the rolls. More chance for his ideology of big government once again in our lives. Also because of Obama's stringent regulations proposed re the coal industry more people will be out of work, more coal plants will be closed and electricity will be more expensive. This affecting the coal mining industry in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia And Pennsylvania. Jobs lost. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Kentucky that has been a blue state for over forty years voted in a Republican governor. Let's hope Pennsylvania and West Virginia will do the same in the upcoming elections. It is the coal mining jobs in these states that are critically being affected by Obama's stringent regulations","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.98,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":295},{"user_id":1111309278912424,"comment_id":10155089278926336,"date":"2017-02-08","message":"Love Louisiana â ¤ï¸","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7901,"user_ideo":0.7988,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.72,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":295},{"user_id":1335187609827033,"comment_id":1336917003026686,"date":"2016-12-14","message":"Failed legacy ,,,","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9815,"user_ideo":0.824,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":295},{"user_id":956701894475524,"comment_id":987102914730925,"date":"2016-09-04","message":"I didn't like the things Colin had to say !!!
