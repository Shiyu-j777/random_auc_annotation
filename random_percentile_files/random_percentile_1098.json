But if a bush ran against trump I would pick bush every time. Trump has already advocated spreading nuclear weapons to more countries, murdering civilians and committing war crimes, punishing any woman who gets an abortion, toss out the Geneva convention and torture people, withdraw from NATO, and ban an entire religion from the country, and create a database of muslims. He said he would deport US citizens and thinks global warming is a hoax created by the chinese, thinks the US should default on its debt, defends the interment of Japanese Americans in WW2. He thinks Obama is a muslim and accused him of not being american and accused him of being an ISIS sympathizer, insulted war heros because they got captured, racially insulted a sitting Senator. He bragged about his dick size in a GOP debate and has suggested he might quit if he's actually elected. He consistently thinks women are only valuable for how they look, with at least a dozen high-profile misogynistic comments. He's called nuking the middle east a plausible option. He has a suspicious number of ties to Putin, and has a history of business deals with organized crime. He's called mexicans rapists and criminals, been successfully sued multiple times for racist rental practices, and said he wants no blacks only jews counting his money. He semi-threatened the pope, mocked disabled people in front of a crowd of thousands, outright threatened violence towards the media and protesters, made sexual comments about his daughters MULTIPLE TIMES, praised Kim Jong Un and Putin and Saddam Hussein, praised the Tianenmen Square massacre. He's flirted with white supremacy - retweeting them, reposting their images with anti-semitic symbols, playing coy about David Duke's endorsement. He's a verified lunatic conspiracy theorist - he thinks the Clintons murdered one of their aides, Obama is a sleeper agent and Ted Cruz's dad helped kill JFK. He could get caught diddling kids and funding ISIS himself and his supporters would eat it up. Either way, Ladies and Gentlemen, your Republican party nominee.\"\"\"\"","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.001,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1098},{"user_id":10206792780566099,"comment_id":1508666636103449,"date":"2016-01-23","message":"Viva Rubio 2016!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9812,"user_ideo":0.5597,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1098},{"user_id":1076427599107809,"comment_id":570886616369265,"date":"2016-08-06","message":"Republican with Hillary!!!
