I'm glad 15 or 16 states now collectively have signed this legislation into law. Hey, LGBT and supporters, read the actual bill it's not the blatant discrimination like your misguided outrage shows. LGBT is nothing but a radical political movement anyways. In this country we have the god given right to believe how we wish and to uphold those beliefs. If you don't like it, too bad. Should we just remove and strip all of our values and morals for the sake of a tiny minority? No, absolutely not, yet that's exactly what the Liberals, Democrats, and LGBT are trying to do. You have your right to an opinion, and beliefs, but if ours differ from your own, nope you won't allow that everyone is suddenly a bigot, or discriminatory. Nonsense.
