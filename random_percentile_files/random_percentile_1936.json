We need people working in this country and off the rolls. The Republicans are in favor of the pipeline therefore it is going to be automatically rejected by Obama. Also he does not want people off the rolls. More chance for his ideology of big government once again in our lives. Also because of Obama's stringent regulations proposed re the coal industry more people will be out of work, more coal plants will be closed and electricity will be more expensive. This affecting the coal mining industry in states such as Kentucky and West Virginia And Pennsylvania. Jobs lost. Perhaps this is one of the reasons Kentucky that has been a blue state for over forty years voted in a Republican governor. Let's hope Pennsylvania and West Virginia will do the same in the upcoming elections.
