Paying someone else's mortgage for them! Spare me. It's simple economics with a blind spot for morality, with no provision for social cohesion. I was renting from 1 man who had a portfolio of 80 small properties, effectively a modern slum Lord. 80 properties off the market, to line his pockets and keep me and others in the rental trap a little longer. He isn't the only person doing this, I read about a married couple with 900 properties. This practice has to stop and targeting landlords is one step towards getting a fairer society.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0045,"user_ideo":-0.3059,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":805},{"comment_id":585626328311526,"date":"2016-09-07","message":"And the BBC, if you're looking for interaction, the telegraph (I think) have a quiz on it","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0196,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":805},{"comment_id":760923227339619,"date":"2015-04-21","message":"Ann Lor stop taking diet pills","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1543,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.25,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":805},{"user_id":1153675301342182,"comment_id":10153677556646336,"date":"2015-09-13","message":"love this judge like her honesty","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9635,"user_ideo":0.8313,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.86,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":805},{"user_id":10208231175069575,"comment_id":10153477312415667,"date":"2016-04-16","message":"They're a national disgrace.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2341,"user_ideo":-0.1586,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.32,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":805},{"user_id":1323796100974610,"comment_id":1142685752456314,"date":"2016-07-22","message":"All these peoples rooting for this clown are the KKK","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0202,"user_ideo":-0.3364,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.08,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":805},{"comment_id":971831199576601,"date":"2015-10-10","message":"That's awesome...wait...I thought Obamacare was supposed to lower costs not just keep it the same for a few while everyone else pays more.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9736,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.88,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":805},{"comment_id":914908691974353,"date":"2016-11-05","message":"Somebody needs to toss her on her fat butt","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9362,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.83,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":805},{"user_id":10153877335987613,"comment_id":10153911727217426,"date":"2016-08-19","message":"Yall do realize the president could care less right.

I never encouraged or discouraged her gender identification. I just supported her as my daughter but kept watching and listening. Her gender identification went through many stages, including her coming out as gay when she was 13. Still, something was amiss. I wondered why she didn't date or even associate with other lesbians. When I finally asked why, she said, \"\"\"\"I am attracted to straight girls\"\"\"\". She went through a difficult and confusing transition through her young life and now, at 19, is a boy, well adjusted and at peace. Such courage he showed and such support he received. I grieve for those that don't have the societal, familial and financial support to become who they truly are. Nobody has the right to define who you are.
