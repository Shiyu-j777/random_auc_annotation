B) We want a desired reaction from the public (e.g., fear) C) we offer our desired solution to the problem; a solution that will always further our goals. In this presentation, I will give you a few examples of this technique in practice; to enlighten you about this technique in the best possible way: Example 1 Let us say I want the ice cream that belongs to a child. I cannot just ask the child, \"\"\"\"can I have your ice cream?\"\"\"\" I know he will most certainly say \"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\". So I use the following technique to manipulate him into wanting to give me his ice cream: Stage 1. I invent a fake problem: \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, a ghost will haunt you in the night\"\"\"\". or \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, God will send you to Hell\"\"\"\" or \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, you will be very unlucky\"\"\"\" (ofcourse I know it is not true, but the child doesn't) Stage 2. I get a desired reaction from the child: Fear: \"\"\"\"please save me from this danger\"\"\"\" Stage 3. I now offer the solution to the problem I invented: I will save you from this danger if you give me the ice cream. \"\"\"\"I will talk to God\"\"\"\" or \"\"\"\"I will chase away the Ghost\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: I want the child to give me his ice cream. Example 2 Let us say we want the oil in Iraq. We cannot just say to the countries of the world: \"\"\"\"hey, let us go to iraq and take their oil\"\"\"\". The public as well as the countries of the world will not agree to such a thing. So we use the PRS manipulation technique: Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: We use the media to say: \"\"\"\"Iraq has nuclear weapons and poses a threat to the world\"\"\"\" Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please big brother America, save the world from destruction\"\"\"\" Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"You must let us invade iraq in order to save the world\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: After the countries of the world have agreed to our invasion and occupation of the target country (Iraq), we can then use the occupation as a way to secretly steal oil in the target country. During the occupation, the oil companies - owned by illumicorp members - may secretly fund and even bribe some of the military forces within the occupied areas to kill innocent civilians that get in the way of our plans. The assigned corporations then silently takes possession of the oil within the occupied territory without the world ever knowing about it. Example 3 Objective: We want the oil or opium in Afghanistan Stage 1. Problem: We create a 9/11. We blame 9/11 on Usama Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Stage 2. Desired Reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please America, save us from Usama Bin Laden.\"\"\"\" Stage 3. Solution to the problem we created: The people demand the big brother of the world - America - to step in and invade & occupy Afghanistan. Agenda of the solution: We want the oil a or opium in Afghanistan. Example 4 Let us say we want the people to behave the way we want them to behave. We cannot just say to people: \"\"\"\"Behave the way we want you to behave\"\"\"\". People would not obey us. They would rebel against such a statement. So we use the PRS technique in order to manipulate the public into behaving the way we want them to behave. Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: \"\"\"\"There is an invisible, jealous, vindictive and judgemental God in the sky. If you dont behave, he will send you to a place called Hell.\"\"\"\" Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear / guilt Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"If you behave, we will talk to God and he will forgive you. And do not forget to pay the church tax.\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: We want the people to behave the way we want them to behave, and no other way. We want to maintain our dominance and control over the population. Example 5 We use the same technique when we want the public to vote for new laws that give us more control over the people; laws they would normally not vote for had it not beenfor the PRS technique. Let us say we want to introduce a new law that further our control over the population (i.e., more CCTV cameras and surveilance). We cannot just say to the people: \"\"\"\"let us have more cameras so that we can have more control over you\"\"\"\". They will say \"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\". So we have to scare the public into demanding the cameras themselves - democratically -. We use the Problem Reaction Solution Technique: Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: 9/11 Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please America, save us from the terrorists\"\"\"\" Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"allow us to have more cameras in order to prevent future terrorist attacks within the country\"\"\"\" (The people democratically demand that they are controlled, in order to be protected from the terrorist) Agenda behind solution: We want more cameras and more police control over the people, to further our control over the population. So we have to give the public a valid reason to democratically vote for it.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0391,"user_ideo":-0.2427,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.11,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":2749},{"user_id":10157263872825263,"comment_id":10154201408065579,"date":"2016-03-02","message":"With you in the white house, it will!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7499,"user_ideo":-0.0623,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.7,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":2749},{"comment_id":1726163847601063,"date":"2016-08-28","message":"Everyone in Virginia needs to see this video.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8724,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.78,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":2749},{"user_id":1149456615112955,"comment_id":10153884352816336,"date":"2015-12-05","message":"You're welcome.

SHE CAN'T DELETE OR HAMMER THOSE BRAIN SEIZURES ANYMORE. A LIE Named Hillary I don¡¯t detest Hillary Clinton because she is a woman. I oppose her because she cannot tell the truth to save her life. Any public servant who has the gall to issue a list of terms the press cannot utter, as if disposing the corpse of free will, is helplessly deluded and a petulant child. Sorry, Hillary, but no one owes you anything; especially the nation you proclaim to serve with nothing but the benevolence of blind ambition. If your candidacy cannot survive without the aid of deception, division, and the fabricated catcalls of ¡°sexism¡± to demonize your critics, then please tell us why America needs you? Better yet, please explain how you¡¯re even worthy of a job? A leader doesn¡¯t need pollsters, a panel of advisors, two news conferences and a room full of media drones just to announce whether or not she used an unauthorized server to conduct official government business and therefore deleted emails in an attempt to avoid prosecution. A leader would never break the law in the first place. And a leader doesn¡¯t shout ¡°what does it matter¡± when four lives are lost in the wake of her unmitigated failure. Any self-respecting adult with an ounce of integrity would simply admit the truth. Excuse me, any self-aware child who knows the difference between right and wrong, life and death.If I¡¯m hiring someone to run my business, placing my future in foreign hands, I don¡¯t care whether you¡¯re a Democrat or Republican, a man or woman, white or black. I want the most qualified candidate whose character speaks for itself and whose ideals can stand on the merits of their own wisdom. That¡¯s common sense. Are you going to have the audacity to tell me what I can and can¡¯t ask; what verbiage is acceptable? If your resume and vision are truly best for the entire nation, not just one party, gender or race, either should be able to withstand the most blistering questions and exhaustive scrutiny. In fact, you should welcome any and all discourse to discredit your detractors and display your competence. A leader unites, empowers and inspires by example, not by excuses or endless blame. Tell me the national debt is a record 18 trillion and that Barack Obama has raised it more than the first 42 presidents combined. Admit that 93 million Americans are out of the workforce, nearly 50 million are on public assistance, and that the economic recovery is a sham. Admonish Iran as a destabilizing force of Islamic radicalism that must never be mentioned in the same sentence as ¡°nuclear power\"\"\"\". Recognize the reality every civilized nation has immigration laws and that American sovereignty, the safety and security of her people, supersedes any political ploy to stuff the ballot box beneath the hollow cries of racism.Yes, just like generations of legal immigrants before your candidacy, respect is given when trust is earned. If you are incapable of acknowledging simple, documented facts - solely because it¡¯s easier to hide behind a propaganda platform that cajoles and incites an expendable public - you¡¯re not interested in solving anything, let alone serving the American people or any notion of truth. You¡¯re the cancer killing the country I love. You¡¯re the lie my forefathers never told.

Kenneth, forgive me for expecting you to think like an investigator. There is no doubt that this is an act of terrorism. Radicalized Islam are willing to give their life freely, which is why they normally commit suicide. This man tried to buy a body armor, which means he planned on coming out of this alive. Next, the killer tried to become a police officer and had friends that were in the police department. Unless the terrorist that he associates with are in the police department, it is unlikely that was associating with terrorist. In addition, we don't know how many people he killed. Three police officers are on leave, chances are the officers are responsible for some of the people killed or wounded. Islam groups have not taken credit, their supporters are praising the attack (you can find that here) My point is let's wait for all the facts to come in before we draw conclusions. Terrorism is associated with politics. How do we know that the motive is not political? Again, let's watch and wait as the facts come in, in the meantime, empathize with the families that lost their loved ones.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1091,"user_ideo":-0.2646,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.2,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":2749},{"user_id":1351367294891519,"comment_id":10153433357623984,"date":"2015-05-28","message":"She can take a flying jump","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.941,"user_ideo":0.7641,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.84,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":2749},{"user_id":829450120490456,"comment_id":10155073191009369,"date":"2017-01-05","message":"He is rich.
