As you get older and make a life for yourself you realize you have to earn what you get and politicians are ALL conmen who live off of taking what other people earn and their programs ALWAYS make things worse. That's why liberals need to constantly turn to the inexperienced naive younger generation. They appeal to your ego, but the fact is older people aren't jaded and more detached from reality. We have more experience and are more aware of reality. We were you once, and you will be us someday shaking your head at the new crop, and the bastards who are manipulating them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9494,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.85,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":645},{"user_id":10201911963517473,"comment_id":10153521916166167,"date":"2016-03-23","message":"Bomb Faux News!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.025,"user_ideo":-0.6341,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.08,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":645},{"user_id":10208673490327264,"comment_id":10154607527504087,"date":"2017-02-26","message":"He is our worst nightmare.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4168,"user_ideo":-0.358,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.47,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":645},{"comment_id":10153912053096234,"date":"2016-08-16","message":"They did the same thing to my childhood home, we were surrounded by farm fields and an orchard and they tore it all out to build $800,000. homes which nobody can manage to even stay in for more than 2 years because they can't afford the taxes on the homes.
