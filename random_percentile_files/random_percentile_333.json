Trump will reign in China's currency manipulation & force them to play FAIR. Trump will stop foreign nations from ripping off #WeThePeople¡¯s U.S. Treasury. Trump will use revenue surpluses to fix/renew our own crumbling infrastructure. ie: Bridges, roads, airports, etc. Trump will end foreign influence over OUR government. Trump will ensure that nations that benefit from defense functions we provide, pay their fair share. Trump, I believe, will be the greatest jobs president America has ever had. Trump will stop dangerous Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTO¡¯s) from killing Americans with their violence and the poison they bring to America. Trump will end the deadly cycle of crime, violence and poverty in our inner cities. Trump is an outsider and beholden to no one, but his supporters, #WeThePeople. Trump is not a ¡politician¡¯ in the conventional meaning. He tells the truth. Trump is a threat to those in power who want to keep the status quo of the system they helped to break. Trump is an Abolitionist Republican who is restoring the proud heritage of the GOP, the party of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and hundreds of other notable people. Trump is a fighter and a bold leader. Trump is a patriot who loves this country. Trump is an American in his heart and soul who will make #AmericaFirst his priority in all decisions. Trump will protect #WeThePeople by restoring Justice for All. Trump will bring back American leadership and global stability to a dangerous world by restoring ¡Peace Through Strength.¡¯ Trump will not get the U.S. involved in war unless there is a clear and present danger to America. Trump will keep the UN busybodies out of OUR business. Donald Trump is 90+% what #WeThePeople have wanted in a president¡¯s policies for DECADES. Leftists say ¡°the system is broken.¡± No it¡¯s not. It¡¯s being misused and abused. Trump will make it work again for ALL Americans. Donald Trump will, in fact, #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9992,"user_ideo":-0.0582,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":333},{"user_id":10154377414107970,"comment_id":10154012873961320,"date":"2016-01-31","message":"Happy Birthday","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6914,"user_ideo":-0.1073,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.66,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":333},{"user_id":1755634564724074,"comment_id":990635367622883,"date":"2015-05-01","message":"He had to find it that way.
