I challenge you to quote this law. If you are so sure that ¡°Palestine , the country, goes back through most of recorded history, I expect you to be able to answer a few basic questions about that country of Palestine :1) When was it founded and by whom? 2) What were its borders? 3) What was its capital? 4) What were its major cities? 5) What constituted the basis of its economy? 6) What was its form of government? 7) Can you name at least one Palestinian leader before Arafat? 8) Was Palestine ever recognized by a country whose existence, at that time or now, leaves no room for interpretation? 9) What was the language of the country of Palestine ? 10) What was the prevalent religion of the country of Palestine ? 11) What was the name of its currency? Choose any date in history and tell what was the approximate exchange rate of the Palestinian monetary unit against the US dollar, German mark, GB pound, Japanese yen, or Chinese yuan on that date. And, finally, since there is no such country today, what caused its demise and when did it occur? You are lamenting the ¡°low sinking¡± of a ¡°once proud¡± nation. Please tell me, when exactly was that ¡°nation¡± proud and what was it so proud of? And here is the least sarcastic question of all: If the people you mistakenly call ¡°Palestinians¡± are anything but generic Arabs collected from all over or thrown out of the Arab world, if they really have a genuine ethnic identity that gives them right for self-determination, why did they never try to become independent until Arabs suffered their devastating defeat in the Six Day War? I hope you avoid the temptation to trace the modern day ¡°Palestinians¡± to the Biblical Philistines: substituting etymology for history won¡¯t work here. The truth should be obvious to everyone who wants to know it. Arab countries have never abandoned the dream of destroying Israel ; they still cherish it today. Having time and again failed to achieve their evil goal with military means, they decided to fight Israel by proxy. For that purpose, they created a terrorist organization, cynically called it ¡°the Palestinian people¡± and installed it in Gaza , Judea, and Samaria . How else can you explain the refusal by Jordan and Egypt to unconditionally accept back the ¡°West Bank¡± and Gaza , respectively","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9704,"user_ideo":-0.082,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.87,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":2940},{"comment_id":10152996909236717,"date":"2015-08-20","message":"So, if after unleashing earthquakes, tornados, tsunamis, destroying traditional marriage, devastating society, and converting children to our way of life through our agenda, we are not happy, what will make us happy???","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9578,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.86,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":2940},{"comment_id":10154203695629087,"date":"2016-10-23","message":"You though the attendees weren't clever and yet your response was the epitome of pure class, apparently.
