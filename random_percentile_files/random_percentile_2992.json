Kasich needs to drop out before he destroys the chance for Cruz to defeat Trump. Too many delegates have already been taken and in my opinion, any vote at this point that isn't for Cruz means it goes against Cruz and helps Trump defeat him. I hope people search their hearts and realize that since Kasich can't win, they should stop Trump by voting for Cruz or the vote is wasted and ultimately helps Trump win. Trump already has 661, Cruz has 406 and Kasich only has 142. Even Rubio had more than Kasich (169 when he dropped out). If people want to keep Trump out, they seriously need to vote for Cruz or its all a lost cause and we will end up with Trump or Hillary........same type person. For some folks, it might be a case of he is the lesser of the evils at this point. He's a heap better than Trump or Hillary. I have had to vote for the \"\"\"\"lesser of the evils\"\"\"\" before and its tough but we can't let Trump or Hillary finish off destroying America.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.8263,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":2992},{"user_id":1253010664738965,"comment_id":10152882028275950,"date":"2015-06-03","message":"This shows the student oh don't worry about it Mommy/Daddy will take of this for you.
