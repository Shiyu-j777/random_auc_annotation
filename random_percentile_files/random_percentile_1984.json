The Democratic Party is now extreme-left Progressive/Socialist. Joe Leiberman was one of the last few JFK-style Democrats left and just look what the Democratic Party did to him! They so attacked and vilified him that he had to leave the Party. Jim Webb is also one of those blue-collar JFK-style Democrats and may even be the last true JFK-style Democrat leader standing. Most Democrats that I speak to are under the impression that the Democratic Party is still \"\"\"\"the party of JFK\"\"\"\" and that is just patently untrue. The Democrat rank-and-file REALLY need to look a lot more closely at just exactly who they are associated with and supporting.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.9048,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.98,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1984},{"user_id":10211735454081404,"comment_id":1135020766594936,"date":"2016-06-24","message":"THE MACHINES!!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2706,"user_ideo":-0.3075,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.35,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1984},{"user_id":10155524101509622,"comment_id":10154654969279497,"date":"2016-09-21","message":"Area man is construction worker laying a new floor.

Overfishing of so many species argues against care for the oceans as being universal, as does the massive amount of netting killing wildlife. Sometimes the question is not whether or not people care, but if they care enough to do the right thing. My sense is that the family farm vs agribusiness analogy works here. Massive nets that sweep up every living thing are not left by small family businesses. And it is also true that some family farms set the standard for humane and environmentally sensitive farming, while other farmers are all about the bottom line and maximizing profits.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0015,"user_ideo":-0.4387,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.02,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1984},{"user_id":10207183022757237,"comment_id":10153276539643717,"date":"2015-09-21","message":"He could have left a different way.

HILLARY CLINTON ALSO RECEIVED MONEY FROM GOLDMAN SACKS !!!!, You MUST know these things! Educate yourselves on him and his wife * Heidi Cruz has been employed by Goldman Sachs since 2005. She is currently on leave. * Heidi Cruz is a member of the leftist council on foreign relations, advocates of world Government and a New World Order. * Ted Cruz was George Bush's top policy advisor. * Ted Cruz was in the federal Trade Commission. * Ted and Heidi met when they were both Bush staffers.( BIG LIE ) TEDDY WHOSE REAL NAME IS RAPHAEL and HEIDI ARE BLOOD COUSINS. * Cruz advised on legal affairs and Heidi on economic policy for the bush administration. * Heidi was director for the Western Hemisphere on the national security council under Condoleeza Rice. * Heidi served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative to USTR head, Robert Zoellick, working on China trade policy. * Ted Cruz' campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, is a former CIA officer. He also worked for Goldman Sachs. * Ted Cruz voted for cloture on TPA, (trans pacific partnership agreement) fast track trade authority, removing the hurdle of concern for further amendment, and clearing the way for passage! It didn't have to be recorded, so nobody knew this. He voted NOT to require approval of congress before other countries could join, including China. * Cruz has openly stated that he will NOT use a deportation force, and will continue to use the failed ICE system, where an illegal has to commit a crime first, then be caught. * Cruz belongs to the radical Christian sect of 7 mountains dominionism, that seeks to place their members in control of our culture and create a NWO though the domination of business, government, media, arts & entertainment, education, family, and religion. He is the appointed messiah/savior of their group. * Ted Cruz has only been a citizen for about 19 months! He renounced his Canadian citizenship in 2014 so he could run for president. There are also other reasons that he is not constitutionally eligible, including the fact that both of his parents were NOT U.S. Citizens when he was born, only his mother was. Wise up, he's not who you think he is he has always been establishment, he is bought and paid by the banks. He did not vote to audit the Federal Reserve, he most certainly is establishment.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1984},{"user_id":10155141131163248,"comment_id":10153734252862894,"date":"2016-06-13","message":"So what if she googled it?
