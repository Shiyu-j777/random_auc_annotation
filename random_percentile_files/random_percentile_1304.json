If you plan to vote for Ted Cruz, you MUST know these things! Educate yourselves on him and his wife* It has also come to my attention with google that Cruz's wife file for separation in 2011 & 2012 and her reason was given as \"\"\"\"infidelity\"\"\"\".........i'm just saying he's lying about this news too!!~ * Heidi Cruz has been employed by Goldman Sachs since 2005. She is currently on leave. * Heidi Cruz is a member of the leftist council on foreign relations, advocates of world Government and a New World Order. * Ted Cruz was George Bush's top policy advisor. * Ted Cruz was in the federal Trade Commission. * Ted and Heidi met when they were both Bush staffers. * Cruz advised on legal affairs and Heidi on economic policy for the bush administration. * Heidi was director for the Western Hemisphere on the national security council under Condoleeza Rice. * Heidi served as deputy U.S. Trade Representative to USTR head, Robert Zoellick, working on China trade policy. * Ted Cruz' campaign chairman, Chad Sweet, is a former CIA officer. He also worked for Goldman Sachs. * Ted Cruz voted for cloture on TPA, (trans pacific partnership agreement) fast track trade authority, removing the hurdle of concern for further amendment, and clearing the way for passage! It didn't have to be recorded, so nobody knew this. He voted NOT to require approval of congress before other countries could join, including China. * Cruz has openly stated that he will NOT use a deportation force, and will continue to use the failed ICE system, where an illegal has to commit a crime first, then be caught. * Cruz belongs to the radical Christian sect of 7 mountains dominionism. Heidi, also was arrested in TX, she was wondering around on a busy main Hwy. in the middle of the night. Police took her to jail and then to a crazy hospital stating she was a danger to others and herself. Wise up, he's not who you think he is he has always been establishment, he is bought and paid by the banks. He did not vote to audit the Federal Reserve, he most certainly is establishment.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9991,"user_ideo":0.426,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1304},{"user_id":1271290719548221,"comment_id":10153731099851051,"date":"2016-04-19","message":"God bless","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8677,"user_ideo":0.7847,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.77,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1304},{"user_id":1584934794866055,"comment_id":10153095521113984,"date":"2015-01-29","message":"they cannot remove the Castros without Arms.....this is why our second amendment is so important- tyranny!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9952,"user_ideo":0.796,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1304},{"user_id":10210315335065925,"comment_id":1054989047874900,"date":"2015-06-11","message":"Stop making stupid people famous... unless they are running for President, and then all bets are off.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0369,"user_ideo":-0.749,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.1,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1304},{"comment_id":10153347900339087,"date":"2015-11-25","message":"Yes that concerned me reading that will Smith was involved with a terrorist group.
