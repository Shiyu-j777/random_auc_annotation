Got a quote earlier in the year were I to retire $2000 a month...you heard me 2 grand a month. It would be more then my social security benefit. Now they say it's going up by double digits. $2400?, $2600, $2800... Does it matter? It simply isn't feasible. So we are like many and the many that will soon discover they can't retire. We are health insurance slaves - we work to fund other people health insurance. (The premiums are high to fund those who can't or won't pay) We lost our Doctor, it is more expensive it is a disaster... You lied. College slavery? Now she wants us to pay for college for other people as well. Are you kidding?
