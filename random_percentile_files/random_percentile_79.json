Does the text - jurisdiction - mean anything to Reason magazine? The 14th amendment was NEVER meant to provide birth right citizenship. It was meant to provide citizenship to former slaves and their children. The textual intent is that citizens of OTHER NATIONS who have children here, fall under the citizenship jurisdiction of the parent's nation. It's fucking stupid to suggest that the 14th amendment was created so vacationing French citizens could birth a child here and have the child be an American - not a French citizen. It is equally absurd to think the intent of the 14th amendment was to provide citizenship to any illegal alien's offspring should they manage to squirt out a child on American soil. Another idiotic policy that has been established by the courts in defiance of the amendments original intent.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9736,"user_ideo":0.0821,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.88,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":79},{"comment_id":10155303650729218,"date":"2017-02-23","message":"Time to head off to bed she's not having that baby anytime soon !!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5305,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.55,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":79},{"comment_id":10155128585306509,"date":"2016-08-05","message":"No more hot tin foil in my country..all pushers already killed..if illominati is true..then are you tough enough to face our \"\"\"\"punisher\"\"\"\" president?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5466,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.56,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":79},{"comment_id":331029413977164,"date":"2017-08-01","message":"Richard, the very same science you use to tell me about those past ice ages and interglacials is the very same science that tells us that humans are impacting the climate now.
