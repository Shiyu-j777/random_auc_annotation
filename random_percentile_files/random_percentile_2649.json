People lived common law long before that as well. How is gay marriage responsible for that when it wasn't legal before 2005, and most people aren't gay? Moreover , why would gays marrying break up marriages unless they were crappy to start with, or if one person was secretly gay? In the latter case, the marriage would probably fall apart anyway. Gays aren't forced to marry-so they could still cheat on an unsuspecting straight spouse, if they are in that situation. Sexual relations and marriage are not the same thing.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0097,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":2649},{"user_id":659089177581233,"comment_id":998555810221286,"date":"2016-03-30","message":"May she rest in Peace!
