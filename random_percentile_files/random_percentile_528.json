First off it makes lots of people lots of money. But the main reason it exists is because it is part of the great deception that God has allowed to come upon his people. The devil hates every human being that is in the image of God and since he has no chance and is destined for hell he wants to take as many people to hell with him. The devil knows that every soul that makes it into heaven will severely continually pierce him for all eternity and remind him of how good and just God is. So, I believe that the devil took the circle disc flat earth map and wrapped it around a ball and left the North Pole as the top of the globe and stretched the wall of ice that surrounds the flat earth down around a ball, and pulled it together at the bottom of a globe earth map and called it Antarctica. Then he rearranged the continents to coordinate the time zones with the sun and made NASA and GPS and a school system that forces us by law to teach our children to believe in the globe earth model as a fact of life. I assume that the way that this was accomplished was through human beings in secret societies and ancient evil families of human-demon hybrids worked directly with the devil. These ancient families paid off the Vatican to get a religious backing to start a globe earth theological crusade to get as many people as possible to trust in what man says about the heavens and the earth instead of what God's word says about the heavens and the earth. All of this was done to have people trust in man and trust in an invisible force that uses evident truths of God's creation tied in with false constructs of reality to pull you to the center of the earth (hell). Out of all the words that the devil could have chosen for this invisible false force he chose the word gravity which means: (bellow is listed the first result on an internet search I did for the definition of the word gravity. I put parenthesis around the words: minor modifications, and I capitalized the word theory. Notice which example sentences are being used in the first search result for the word gravity. The devil obviously wants everyone to know he is a poetic criminal) 1. the force that attracts a body toward the center of the earth, or toward any other physical body having mass. For most purposes Newton's laws of gravity apply, with \"\"\"\"minor modifications\"\"\"\"to take the general THEORY of relativity into account. 2. the degree of intensity of this, measured by acceleration. extreme or alarming importance; seriousness: \"\"\"\"crimes of the utmost gravity\"\"\"\" 3. seriousness or solemnity of manner: \"\"\"\"has the poet ever spoken with greater eloquence or gravity?\"\"\"\" The devil knew that men would believe the vain traditions of men over God's word which says that the earth is a circle with a dome firmament over it and that God sits on His throne over the earth and sees everyone all at the same time. The bible also says that God hung the earth on nothing and it will never move which means that it is not spinning and hurtling through space at mind bending speeds. The devil has people meditating on gravity and on people hanging off the side and the bottom of the earth and hurtling through space at warp speed when the Holy Spirit inspired word of God says that we are standing still. When you don't believe what the bible says then you automatically become a crazy person. Then you start doing things like send your children to the pool in underwear and raise your kids on cartoons from Disney (which has 666 in the letters) and you will even fight people that try to warn you about subjecting your children to vain traditions of men that are killing their souls all in the name of money (mammon) and pride. Then your kids end up hating the real Jesus all because you decided to disregard what the bible says about the earth you live in and the God you serve.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9739,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.88,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":528},{"user_id":1053378858032620,"comment_id":991514967550591,"date":"2015-11-06","message":"This isa lie brought to you by the Republican Establishment.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9663,"user_ideo":0.4816,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.87,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":528},{"comment_id":10153860637501336,"date":"2015-11-24","message":"Isn't he the idiot that dumped Princess Diana for that hag, Camilla","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3729,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.44,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":528},{"comment_id":492960414244947,"date":"2016-01-27","message":"So with this kind of backwards thinking, l can go to a national park and commandeer the snack bar....just because there was a park admission fee!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2129,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.3,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":528},{"user_id":10154479725408307,"comment_id":911259275578080,"date":"2015-06-03","message":"They should rule against it just to piss off Obama! :)","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9822,"user_ideo":0.8327,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.89,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":528},{"user_id":10211530334401081,"comment_id":10152776643970667,"date":"2015-05-16","message":"Natalia Donnelly","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0316,"user_ideo":-0.1762,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.1,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":528},{"user_id":10205097863965460,"comment_id":10153273219619342,"date":"2015-08-09","message":"She was not a victim.
