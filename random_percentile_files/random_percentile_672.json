If a man wore that his balls would hang out - that was where I was going. Just because her vagina doesn't fall out, I still find it indecent. It's an inappropriate garment full stop. It's not a matter of masculine / feminine for me - it's just plain inappropriate. 2. I've no problem with men wearing skirts or make up in public and I know no one who would. I have no issue with fluid gender - my experience across the U.K. is that if you're a nice person, no one cares. (Maybe different in schools!?). Maybe we're more liberal than you guys in the USA. That said if men chose to wear skirts etc, they - like women - have to be a socially acceptable length. That's to say his balls and arse aren't to hanging out. That IS important here. You may call it old fashioned, I call it common decency. 3. Mulan, Disney film for kids. She is referred to as a 'cross dresser'. So no, it's not only applied to men. So I think your anger is a bit misplaced and you've turned a gender less comment on appropriateness of attire into a wider debate on gender....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0027,"user_ideo":-0.3488,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":672},{"user_id":10209815381958283,"comment_id":10153332418427235,"date":"2015-05-17","message":"\"\"\"\"The researchers found that adherents to conspiracy theories are highly receptive to claims that support their views and rarely engage with social media pages that question their beliefs.\"\"\"\" That works with any belief system.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0168,"user_ideo":-0.4229,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":672},{"user_id":10208936980996231,"comment_id":10154306103497629,"date":"2016-07-18","message":"True","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7314,"user_ideo":0.492,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.69,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":672},{"comment_id":10154084414798188,"date":"2016-03-28","message":"this actually helps cruz ,,try out that common core math ,,,,2 muslims - one muslim === three states for cruz ,,,,,i think he just beat trump way to go!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9898,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.91,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":672},{"comment_id":10153375850401234,"date":"2016-01-04","message":"I think life goes on","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5769,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.58,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":672},{"user_id":10154479949877139,"comment_id":1171644826180319,"date":"2016-01-19","message":"Why are they so hung up on the Oscars?
