Leslie i don't think you're right. Before you keel over with anger. 1. If a man wore that his balls would hang out - that was where I was going. Just because her vagina doesn't fall out, I still find it indecent. It's an inappropriate garment full stop. It's not a matter of masculine / feminine for me - it's just plain inappropriate. 2. I've no problem with men wearing skirts or make up in public and I know no one who would. I have no issue with fluid gender - my experience across the U.K. is that if you're a nice person, no one cares. (Maybe different in schools!?). Maybe we're more liberal than you guys in the USA. That said if men chose to wear skirts etc, they - like women - have to be a socially acceptable length. That's to say his balls and arse aren't to hanging out. That IS important here. You may call it old fashioned, I call it common decency. 3. Mulan, Disney film for kids. She is referred to as a 'cross dresser'. So no, it's not only applied to men. So I think your anger is a bit misplaced and you've turned a gender less comment on appropriateness of attire into a wider debate on gender....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0027,"user_ideo":-0.3488,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":2234},{"user_id":1141953202493824,"comment_id":10153100061347093,"date":"2015-09-29","message":"That's right Nan","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.824,"user_ideo":0.1184,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.74,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":2234},{"user_id":1402153856467248,"comment_id":10154445183974255,"date":"2016-07-14","message":"Cruz is just plain creepy and of his controlling women's body bill are a bunch of baloney.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0101,"user_ideo":-0.7675,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":2234},{"user_id":1633874143569314,"comment_id":10153647927866051,"date":"2016-03-18","message":"Where is her body??","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3996,"user_ideo":0.5153,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.46,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":2234},{"user_id":10154353654570396,"comment_id":10154079651989071,"date":"2016-11-12","message":"Then you wait for an operator...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3336,"user_ideo":0.5085,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.41,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":2234},{"user_id":1664400480548926,"comment_id":10153894474051409,"date":"2016-09-21","message":"Respect to the school lunch worker!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4269,"user_ideo":-0.2614,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.48,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":2234},{"comment_id":10154107525772014,"date":"2016-12-29","message":"BOY scouts.
