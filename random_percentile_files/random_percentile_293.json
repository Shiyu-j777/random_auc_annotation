All I see is 3rd wave bullshit feminism everywhere in our overly pc world. To comment on the original topic alot of that is pretty messed up. I can't say I've ever sent anything like that to a girl. In fact one of my favorite lines if a girl asks if I'm asking for a nude is I'm a hands on kind of guy, I'm not really into those kinds pictures. If it's as common place as women in the comments are claiming it to be then I'm genuinely surprised, I don't see more screen shots like this in my news feed. If you're talking about the objectivity and sex of women then I suppose you're talking about what we see on tv, movies or in magazines. However those women in the movies and on tv agreed to be sexualized in that way. In fact some women spend their entire lives being photographed and recorded barely wearing anything or nothing at all. They make more money in a week then what most people make in a month and sometimes even years. Guess what? Men too. Know what that means? Women sexualize men too. Megan fox was in transformers for washing a car in a bathing suit better than the rest of the girls.
