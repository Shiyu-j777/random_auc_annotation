HANDguns murder half of all murder victims, and over twice as many suicides are by HANDgun. Which is interesting because 1/3 of all US households have a gun, but they're used in a very small number of murders. Only 1/5 of black US households have a gun. And 2/3 of all guns are owned by just 1/5 of gun owners. This means that 2/3 of all guns are owned by 1/15 of Americans. The average gun owner now owns 8 guns here. This means that 8 guns is what the average comes to if they're all distributed evenly among the 1/3 of all gun owners. They are not. It is a very paranoid and idiotic minority of Americans, WELL under 10% of people, who are rabidly against gun control of any kind. OVER 95% of ALL Americans favor VERY stringent Background checks, some limits on gun types, Mental Health checks, practical testing (as with getting drivers license), licensing, registration AND insurance for EVERY FIREARM. It is important to note that the Second Amendment protects being armed but has never been a free-for-all. We aren't allowed to walk around with grenade launchers or SMR tubes on our backs. We're not allowed to walk around with a \"\"\"\"flame thrower.\"\"\"\" So there ARE limits on arms, even in bladed arms. And that's key. Guns are NOT the only arms, and they weren't when the Constitution was written. People carried knives for protection and as a tool. If you have a knife on you, you're armed, and that can be regulated, and is, too. Gun people are insane in this country. Civilians do NOT need handguns. Period. 3/4 of all murders, rapes, assaults, home invasions, burglaries are by people well known to the victims here: Family, Friends, coworkers, teammates, schoolmates, fellow church members, etc. People who carry handguns are protecting themselves against, first and foremost, their families. The solution to gun violence, obviously as shown in the example here of Australia's dramatic drops in murder and gun murder, is NOT more guns. MORE guns is NOT the solution to gun violence!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"user_ideo":-0.1623,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":2863},{"user_id":10102213641427245,"comment_id":10154449657736323,"date":"2016-08-21","message":"Because you are signed into a contract before you start the job and realise its unsafe?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0603,"user_ideo":-0.3729,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":2863},{"comment_id":1448002508584710,"date":"2017-02-24","message":"my standard Beyonce answer ------->>>> who gives a shit","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7683,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.71,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":2863},{"user_id":10207106923337851,"comment_id":881362545256828,"date":"2015-02-05","message":"\"\"\"\"Cat meat is an illegal dish in Vietnam but restaurants serving it have boomed in popularity in Hanoi recently in part because of a crackdown on the dog meat trade.\"\"\"\" OMG!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0598,"user_ideo":0.571,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":2863}]
