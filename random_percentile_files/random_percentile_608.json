Retired senior US military pilots are increasingly alarmed that Hillary Clintonâ€s proposal for â€œno-fly zonesâ€ in Syria could lead to a military confrontation with Russia that could escalate to levels that were previously unthinkable in the post-cold war world. The Guardian, Oct 25 Despite opposition from the whitehouse , Clinton insisted on imposing a no fly zone in Syria â€œTo have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defenses, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so weâ€re not putting our pilots at riskâ€” youâ€re going to kill alot of Syrians,â€ Clinton admitted.

Clinton. â€œAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.â€ Clinton has been an unremitting supporter of Israeli aggression, whenever it occurs. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz described her last year as â€œIsraelâ€s new lawyerâ€ given her sympathetic view of Binyamin Netanyahuâ€s 2014 bombardment of Gaza and even his desire to maintain â€œsecurityâ€ throughout the occupied West Bank #jillnothill #steinbaraka2016 #5percent Actress Susan Sarandon : \"\"\"\"I'm therefore very happy to endorse Jill Stein for the presidency because she does stand for everything I believe in.
