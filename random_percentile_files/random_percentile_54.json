No conservative is afraid of Trump they clearly see he changes his mind more than anyone on either side. If Trump can win then so be it but remember Obama got elected twice. Winning doesn't mean you're the best person for the job. The Corker bill was a joke and caused the Iran deal to pass. That dumbass shouldn't be telling anyone what to do. Whole bunch of people got on the panther train this last season and the Broncos won. Don't count you chickens till they hatch. Trump is in the lead but he hasn't secured the nomination yet.

Not a Monty Python movie. A Peter Sellers movie. I just happened to remember the plot to \"\"\"\"Being There\"\"\"\": It is a placid fable about Chance (Peter Sellers), a reclusive, illiterate, passive and simple-minded gardener who is well-groomed, fed on schedule, and dressed in custom-tailored suits, has lived his whole sheltered life on the walled-in estate of an eccentric millionaire named Jennings (his father?). His only knowledge of the \"\"\"\"real\"\"\"\" outside world, an encroaching inner-city ghetto area, is through watching television. When Chance's benefactor dies, he is evicted by the estate's lawyers and wanders aimlessly and helplessly into the streets of Washington, D. C. As he emerges into the outside world, he is struck by a limousine owned by Eve Rand (Shirley MacLaine) and bruises his legs. She takes him to her dying, patriarchal, industrialist husband Benjamin's (Melvyn Douglas) home for treatment from her personal physician Dr. Allenby (Richard Dysart) and recuperation. During the trip, he identifies himself as \"\"\"\"Chance...the gardener,\"\"\"\" which is incorrectly interpreted to be his full name - Chauncey Gardiner. Chance's empty-headed pronouncements and generalizations, delivered dead-pan, are taken to be profoundly intelligent, metaphorically deep, and wisely insightful. He becomes wealthy, is treated as a famous celebrity in the media, and becomes a political advisor for the rich and powerful, including President 'Bobby' (Jack Warden). His new-found popularity leads to talk-show appearances, insider parties, book publisher advances, and the potential to become a presidential candidate.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0428,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.11,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":54},{"comment_id":10153914654271336,"date":"2015-12-17","message":"So beautiful!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3809,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.44,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":54},{"user_id":10210192433870590,"comment_id":10154952475339749,"date":"2016-11-25","message":"Somesh Yadav Beena Yadav Sumegha Yadav","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0798,"user_ideo":-0.361,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.17,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":54}]
