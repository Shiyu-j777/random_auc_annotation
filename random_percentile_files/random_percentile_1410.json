He is unfortunately the POTUS, but I have zero respect for him. I only hope we can survive him ... part of surviving, is making sure we speak out and most importantly show up at the voting booth to get rid of Trump and his supporters in Congress one election at a time. Next is to identify, vet and rally around an acceptable replacement for him within 3 years. Sad that he was the best that we could come up with for GOP nominee for President.
