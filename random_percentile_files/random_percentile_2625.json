Is it time for the South (and Midwest) to finally complete the secession it began 154 years ago? Christian Civil Disobedience That Does NOT Require Climbing a Flagpole, Begins! \"\"\"\"A North Texas county clerk said she has no intention of issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. \"\"\"\"Hood County Clerk Katie Lang released a statement Tuesday saying that she agrees with Attorney General Ken Paxton's opinion on the Supreme Court's ruling. \"\"\"\"'We find that although it fabricated a new constitutional right in 2015, the Supreme Court did not diminish, overrule, or call into question the First Amendment rights to free exercise of religion that formed the first freedom in the Bill of Rights in 1791. This newly invented federal constitutional right to same-sex marriage should peaceably coexist alongside longstanding constitutional and statutory rights, including the right to free exercise of religion and speech,' she said. \"\"\"\"Lang told the Texas Tribune that she was standing up for her religious liberty and that she believes 'marriage is for one man and one woman because it did derive from the Bible.' \"\"\"\"She added that no same-sex couples in Hood County have tried to obtain a marriage license. \"\"\"\"Paxton did issued a written opinion telling clerks with religious exemptions they don't have to issue the licenses. He also warned they could face fines or even lawsuits, but said he would have lawyers available at no-cost for those employees.\"\"\"\" NOTE: We can and should avoid a 2nd Civil War. The majority of the military - Good Ole Boys from the South and Midwest - will fight for the Sexit, bringing our Stars & Stripes and other Battle Flags with them. To avoid a bloodbath the Godless Progressives from the coasts and Northeast should surrender peaceably; we'll give them a fair portion of land as below - they can have Obama's Hawaii and will taken Palin's Alaska, we'll negotiate strong border, immigration and trade policies, and say \"\"\"\"adios!\"\"\"\" We'll take with U.S. Christianity and Judaism, anti-filicide via abortion laws, strong historical and Biblical laws enforcing one man and one woman marriage, enforceable Voter ID laws, market-driven healthcare that eschews Obamacare and SCOTUScare, our precious 1st and 2nd amendments including comprehensively uninfringeable rights of speech, religion, and firearm ownership, free-market commerce with a bare minimum of regulations, and we'll leave the bi-coastals with Godless atheism, murderous abortion, homosexual, bisexual, polyamorous polygamous, and bestial weddings, rules that ensure that only the criminals possess guns, political correctness, and multi-ethnic, minority-identity politics. Would that we'd ALL be as bold and faithful as Katie Lang if confronted with similar oppression for our faith.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9985,"user_ideo":-0.3687,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.96,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":2625},{"user_id":1533172993375428,"comment_id":10155740626116509,"date":"2016-12-12","message":"why does Washington support the Salafist mercenaries against Syria's secular government?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0597,"user_ideo":-0.1874,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":2625},{"user_id":10210661139429075,"comment_id":1011663728893375,"date":"2015-08-01","message":"I carry a really neat hammer claw that would break out a window...
