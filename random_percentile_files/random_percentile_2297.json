BLAME! That is the word for today! No one BLAMED BUSH for 911 or the 10,000 American Deaths from the subsequent wars. NO one blamed Rudy Guiliani for 911. Bush was the President and Rudy was the Mayor then, but neither did ANYTHING to stop the attack and NOW, Rudy is making MILLIONS on speeches about 911. Rudy makes more per speech than Hillary. So why blame her for giving paid speeches, when Rudy makes more by using the deaths of 911 for self gain? Why is there such a need to BLAME Hillary for 4 deaths in Benghazi, when she even requested more money from Congress twice for security and they said NO. So, I'd like to know how she is responsible for Benghazi any more than Bush is responsible for 911 and the war deaths? What about the 60 deaths at embassies during the Rice and Powell tenures? WHY MUST A WOMAN BE BLAMED FOR 4 DEATHS and a MAN NOT BE BLAMED FOR OVER 10,000 AMERICAN DEATHS AND OVER 100,000 civilian deaths in two foreign countries? IS IT OK FOR A MAN TO BE IN CHARGE WHEN PEOPLE GET KILLED, BUT NOT OK FOR A WOMAN TO BE IN CHARGE WHEN PEOPLE GET KILLED? The Benghazi deaths are on Obama, anyway. It was his administration. I think there must be some kind of gender prejudice going on, because former Secretaries of State had private servers and got more people killed that Hillary. Are that many people in this country really that STUPID? I BLAME FOX, CNN and other media for gender bias and ALLOWING donald to get away with LYING every 3.25 minutes for 18 months, and really for his whole life! Even now, you are NOT covering all of his LIES, CORRUPTION, CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR, PANDERING and CONFLICT OF INTERESTS. OH sure, you wanted him as President, so you can make BILLIONS off of his INSANITY, because his craziness sells advertising, but you have SOLD YOUR COUNTRY OUT! The media & comedians will make a killing; the middle class will take a beating & have to pay heavily for YOUR mistakes. We have a free country, because of free press, but the press is NOT free anymore. You in the PRESS had better start doing YOUR JOBS or kiss democracy GOODBYE and go down in history as the most STUPID, ARROGANT, and INCOMPETENT of Organizations in HISTORY!! donald is a disaster and all those that voted for him will get the screws sent to them very soon in a tweet! Literal screws, not figurative! Good luck with that, donald sheeples.
