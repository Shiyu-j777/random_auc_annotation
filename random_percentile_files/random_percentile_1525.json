It is easy to understand that the confusion about milkâ€s imaginary benefits stems from the fact that it contains calcium â€“ around 300 mg per cup. But many scientific studies have shown an assortment of detrimental health effects directly linked to milk consumption. And the most surprising link is that not only do we barely absorb the calcium in cowâ€s milk (especially if pasteurized), but to make matters worse, it actually increases calcium loss from the bones. What an irony this is! Hereâ€s how it happens. Like all animal protein, milk acidifies the body pH which in turn triggers a biological correction. You see, calcium is an excellent acid neutralizer and the biggest storage of calcium in the body is â€“ you guessed itâ€¦ in the bones. So the very same calcium that our bones need to stay strong is utilized to neutralize the acidifying effect of milk. Once calcium is pulled out of the bones, it leaves the body via the urine, so that the surprising net result after this is an actual calcium deficit.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0192,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1525},{"user_id":10207157999736853,"comment_id":10153654474861162,"date":"2015-08-21","message":"Then why did she say \"\"\"\"I'll cut you up WHITE GIRL\"\"\"\"!!!!!!
