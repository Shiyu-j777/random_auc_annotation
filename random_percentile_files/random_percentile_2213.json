Against catholics, against Trump supporters, against Bernie supporters, against blacks calling them super predators, she is not for America Period! And also wants to take our christian beliefs away from us Americans! Wants to take away our constitutional rights! And wants to appoint corrupt people in the supreme court justice! How in the heck can anyone vote for her!
