Hillary Clinton and Obama are clearly a part of this ISLAMIC CALIPHATE AGENDA!!! No such thing as islamophobia, our concerns are valid and supported by evidence. Our politicians still don't get it. The Americans, and all of Europe for that matter, are facing three choices: Expulsion of the Muslim invaders. Extermination of the Muslim invaders. Extinction of the American/European cultures . They can only pick one. Those are the choices on the table thanks to the idiocy known as \"\"\"\"multiculturalism\"\"\"\". The Man Who Warned Us About Islam 750 Years Ago is Still Relevant Today The 13th-century scholar Thomas Aquinas, regarded as one of the most eminent medieval philosophers and theologians, offered a biting critique of Islam based in large part on the questionable character and methods of its founder, Mohammed. According to Aquinas, Islam appealed to ignorant, brutish, carnal men and spread not by the power of its arguments or divine grace but by the power of the sword. Aquinas, a keen observer of the human condition, was familiar with the chief works of the Muslim philosophers of his dayâ€“including Avicenna, Algazel, and Averroesâ€“and engaged them in his writings. Since Islam was founded and spread in the seventh century, Aquinasâ€”considered by Catholics as a saint and doctor of the Churchâ€”lived in a period closer to that of Mohammed than to our own day. In one of his most significant works, the voluminous Summa contra gentiles, which Aquinas wrote between 1258 and 1264 AD, the scholar argued for the truth of Christianity against other belief systems, including Islam. Aquinas contrasts the spread of Christianity with that of Islam, arguing that much of Christianityâ€s early success stemmed from widespread belief in the miracles of Jesus, whereas the spread of Islam was worked through the promise of sensual pleasures and the violence of the sword. Mohammad, Aquinas wrote, â€œseduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure.â€ Such an offer, Aquinas contended, appealed to a certain type of person of limited virtue and wisdom. â€œIn all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men,â€ he wrote. â€œAs for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths that he taught he mingled with many fables and with doctrines of the greatest falsity.â€ Because of the weakness of Islamâ€s contentions, Aquinas argued, â€œno wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning.â€ Instead, those who believed in him â€œwere brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Muhammad forced others to become his followers by the violence of his arms.â€ Islamâ€s violent methods of propagation were especially unconvincing to Aquinas, since he found that the use of such force does not prove the truth of oneâ€s claims, and are the means typically used by evil men. â€œMohammad said that he was sent in the power of his arms,â€ Aquinas wrote, â€œwhich are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants.â€","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":-0.1867,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":1,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":2057},{"comment_id":10154355118599255,"date":"2016-06-12","message":"and I might add to republicans there's also another way along with what was written you need to drop the Paul Ryan budget all together no more privatization of Social Security and no more privatization of Medicare no more turning Medicaid and food stamps over to the states you have to make reasonable reforms and work with your Democratic colleagues you need to accept the fact you can't privatize everything get rid of the waste and abuse by coming up with reasonable reforms that does not affect disabled and elderly people the other thing is you're not going to like this but you need to also except that you're going to need to raise the minimum wage the other things you're going to have to do or else you will continue to lose","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0024,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.03,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":2057},{"user_id":1820869721479675,"comment_id":10153654878758132,"date":"2015-07-06","message":"Congratulations !
