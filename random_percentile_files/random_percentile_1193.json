What qualified Hillary as a senator or as President, other than she lived as a wife in the White House? Given her lies, how can we believe that she won't serve her best interests first and ours later when it benefits her? Will any world leader take her seriously? Has she won back the respect of our military after Benghazi? In her platform, she has already declared a war on our 2nd Amendment rights. As a woman, I would love to see a strong woman President in my lifetime, but not this one. I cannot vote for a woman who has built her career on dishonesty and deceit. Considering how divided our country has been, I'm willing to give a non-politician a chance. One of Trump's best qualities is that he knows how to motivate and lead people. There is also an honest willingness to make our country better.

Here is the genuine incarnate truth as I believe I heard it and I wasnâ€t the least surprised: Trump The Snorters estimation of his own wealth is way above the true figure. Today, itâ€s more likely his real wealth is no more than a deplorable $ 75million - perhaps $100 million. Snorter, You ain't belong amongst the real rich guys with that kind'a meager peanuts! The real rich guys all have been invited to have a GS Diamond Black Millennium Card (less than a thousand people world-wide has been invited). I guess you haven't received such an invitation, eah Snorter? Always remember The Snorter is a highly vulnerable, extremely jealous and compulsive liar, who donâ€t give a damn about the law and who by nature easily can act as a dangerous criminal.
