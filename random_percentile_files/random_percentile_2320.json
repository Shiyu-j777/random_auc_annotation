My daughter identified as a boy, verbally stating \"\"\"\"I am a boy\"\"\"\" when she was four years old. When We met strangers they would ask what my \"\"\"\"son's\"\"\"\" name was. Waiters would ask what the \"\"\"\"young man\"\"\"\" would like to eat. I observed and knew that there was a deep gender dysphoria at work. I never encouraged or discouraged her gender identification. I just supported her as my daughter but kept watching and listening. Her gender identification went through many stages, including her coming out as gay when she was 13. Still, something was amiss. I wondered why she didn't date or even associate with other lesbians. When I finally asked why, she said, \"\"\"\"I am attracted to straight girls\"\"\"\". She went through a difficult and confusing transition through her young life and now, at 19, is a boy, well adjusted and at peace. Such courage he showed and such support he received. I grieve for those that don't have the societal, familial and financial support to become who they truly are. Nobody has the right to define who you are. To do otherwise is an act of violence.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0086,"user_ideo":0.8532,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":2320},{"comment_id":10153288959952217,"date":"2015-12-27","message":"Britons had better migrate to middle east","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.933,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.83,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":2320},{"user_id":1250856261591676,"comment_id":10152986673322452,"date":"2015-07-31","message":"he shouldn't be charge he didn't know he was 14 years old.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7195,"user_ideo":-0.1747,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.68,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":2320},{"user_id":882491978551116,"comment_id":10154258810654091,"date":"2016-12-06","message":"That's by my house!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2876,"user_ideo":-0.312,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.37,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":2320},{"user_id":578870625636466,"comment_id":10154951793393279,"date":"2017-01-31","message":"The people I consider family and friends in rural America are Not laughing.
