It's sad that you have put yourself on a pedestal and believe yourself to be above others who are simply trying to live a better life. Most of these people come from countries that subject them to terrible conditions. I have nothing against deporting criminals who committed violent crimes, but the lack of empathy toward other human beings whose only crime was to cross a border (whether crossing the actual border or overstaying their time through a visa) is what is truly troubling. Illegal immigrants and permanent residents are all afraid. To be clear, the vetting process and pathway to citizenship was much simpler back in the day.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.004,"user_ideo":-0.0713,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.04,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":2885},{"user_id":1244051269000623,"comment_id":942050262537869,"date":"2015-10-03","message":"Another DC MORON !!!!!
