You already make two or three times what non-union workers make, even though you lazy jerks don't work nearly as hard. But that's somehow never enough for you. And you have the nerve to call other people greedy! As a truck driver, i absolutely despise when i have to go to a union warehouse or factory. They are ALWAYS incredibly rude and extremely slow. It's very common for me to spend an entire day there, because they take their own sweet time. No sense in working hard when you're guaranteed a ridiculously high wage regardless of how hard you work. So spare me the lies and propaganda.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9885,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.91,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":2013},{"comment_id":1823842171184098,"date":"2016-10-20","message":"Dems only care about themselves","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.996,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.94,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":2013},{"comment_id":385001035220202,"date":"2017-03-17","message":"Idiots","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7041,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.67,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":2013},{"user_id":1073142079441526,"comment_id":1726677657548971,"date":"2016-06-14","message":"to bad he wasnt in that club","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8389,"user_ideo":0.7558,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.75,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":2013},{"user_id":1185242724878954,"comment_id":668295033353074,"date":"2016-12-09","message":"all you babe!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0624,"user_ideo":-0.5156,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":2013},{"user_id":10154133925403277,"comment_id":1003557823030314,"date":"2015-06-17","message":"Then none of us will be safe!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5345,"user_ideo":0.8152,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.56,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":2013},{"user_id":10208484307198654,"comment_id":883093598392729,"date":"2015-05-13","message":"Obama is pure evil","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9992,"user_ideo":0.7966,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.98,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":2013},{"user_id":10153616072861816,"comment_id":10154054831935950,"date":"2016-11-08","message":"Trump will bring industry/manufacturing back to America & put Americans back to work.

Trump is not a ¡politician¡¯ in the conventional meaning. He tells the truth. Trump is a threat to those in power who want to keep the status quo of the system they helped to break. Trump is an Abolitionist Republican who is restoring the proud heritage of the GOP, the party of Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and hundreds of other notable people. Trump is a fighter and a bold leader. Trump is a patriot who loves this country.
