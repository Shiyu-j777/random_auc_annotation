The elitist way of treating the country like they know what is best for everyone because we are too stupid to decide for ourselves--too much big government and welfare, unemployment compensation going on for years that does not encourage people to work at getting any kind of job. He could have instituted job training programs, more public works programs that put people to work, but instead he gives handouts. My good friend, a black professional, says she is infuriated by this \"\"\"\"plantation mentality\"\"\"\" of his. If you train people to do a skill or trade they can support themselves.

I'm glad 15 or 16 states now collectively have signed this legislation into law. Hey, LGBT and supporters, read the actual bill it's not the blatant discrimination like your misguided outrage shows. LGBT is nothing but a radical political movement anyways. In this country we have the god given right to believe how we wish and to uphold those beliefs. If you don't like it, too bad. Should we just remove and strip all of our values and morals for the sake of a tiny minority? No, absolutely not, yet that's exactly what the Liberals, Democrats, and LGBT are trying to do. You have your right to an opinion, and beliefs, but if ours differ from your own, nope you won't allow that everyone is suddenly a bigot, or discriminatory. Nonsense.
