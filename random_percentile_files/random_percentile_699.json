Soon we doubters were derided and called anti-American.If you were not pro war with no proof you were on the side of terrorists.Everyday the words would shift,one day we should attack the people due to 911,they hate us for our freedoms,next time they told us our bombs would be welcomed,we would be saving the Iraqis,next day something else.When Bush spoke of tyrants and tyranny,he was describing himself.People were growing hysterical and the media acted as a tool for the greedy war mongers.Yet no proof of wmds. Soon people,cowards, couldn't get us to war fast enough.Never with proof of anything.Our young enthusiastically and naively signed on,to kill those Iraqi 'terrorists,not caring that 911 was not due to Iraq.All the change that came about in the minds of the masses with no proof.Look at the destruction on grand scale, globally accomplished during that corrupt and greedy regime.It continues on.That is how the (anti) Patriot act passed.Fear,fear,fear.I see once again the anger towards persons who dare question.Don't question or you are falsely accused of being pro-Trump,pro-Putin. Don't want to be unAmerkin,now do we. Just a trace of proof? Otherwise it is more fear and anger based propaganda.Works well.And the DNC diverted attention from their dirty work.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0157,"user_ideo":-0.7672,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.07,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":699},{"user_id":1069611733092485,"comment_id":10152830575827507,"date":"2015-04-14","message":"Once you try local grass fed or grain finished beef that gas been humanely(stress free) killed and properly aged, you won't be able to eat store bought anymore.:)","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1588,"user_ideo":-0.4078,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.25,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":699},{"comment_id":603872833094826,"date":"2015-12-22","message":"Charles I am spreading the Lord's message.
