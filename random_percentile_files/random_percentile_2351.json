Apparently, Hillary Clinton is losing her women supporters because of her vulgar and unrestrained attempts to be crowned the president of the USA and her vicious, unsubstantiated, and outright absurd accusations of Donald Trump. Meanwhile, another batch of emails released just recently proves ones again how far Hillary Clinton has gone in her unrestrained crave for power and haughty disregard for the well-being and security of her fellow Americans. In their turn, most people disregard the liberal mediaâ€s sustained partisan and politically motivated coverage of this horrible woman and her campaign. It is a common knowledge that her disdainful political scheming and hapless diplomatic career have done no good to anyone except a very narrow circle of the Clintonsâ€ closest friends, including their family foundation donors and their political cronies. As they keep grasping at straws of political power in DC, the Clintons and their super rich friends have left the American people out to lead miserable existence in the face of impending economic catastrophe. It becomes all too obvious in all that dilapidated public infrastructure, abandoned inner cities, burgeoning immigration crisis, increased social and political unrest along the racial lines, crumbling education system, misaligned health care, and increasingly neglected and depleted military. The newly released emails that the F.B.I. collected as part of its investigation into her illegal use of private email server are certainly connected with the controversy about Hillary Clintonâ€s State Department tenure. Her criminal activities also involved accepting donations to her familyâ€s charity, the Clinton Foundation that became a treasonous avenue of approach to the family and the US government by criminal personalities, for-profit institutions, and foreign governments. The emails once again revealed the degree of criminality and incompetence of Hillary Clinton who as Secretary of State convinced Barack Obama, among other things, to authorize a covert operation in Libya. Because of her incompetence and greed, Hillary Clinton had the US government forced to send American troops to Libya. She and President Barack Obama ended up making one of the most crucial mistakes of the century by arming Al-Qaeda terrorist fighters there in preparation for an attack by the French and British air forces. Her abominable incompetence has been revealed in Hillary Clintonâ€s emails that has come to light last Friday. They prove that the real motive for war in Libya was blocking Gaddafiâ€s plan to harness Libyaâ€s sovereign funds to establish independent financial organizations. The Libyan leader planned to consolidate the African Union and establish a single African currency that could serve as an alternative to the CFA Franc. As ever, Hillary Clinton was guided by the interests of her super rich friends, including the foreign donors to the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton familyâ€s global charitable network. No wonder the emails pertaining to that particular time period of Hillaryâ€s being Secretary of State have been deleted by her. As a result, US troops were sent to endangered and innocent American lives lost in Benghazi. Because of Hillary Clintonâ€s direct incompetence as Secretary of State, the US governmentâ€s acquiescence led to its NATO allies in Europe becoming increasingly involved in the Middle East conflict. The Gulf Monarchies were allowed to take most active part in the Libyan war. It eventually destroyed the state of Libya and allowed tens of thousands of radical Islamic terrorists infiltrate the country. This made possible the creation and armament of ISIS there. It is due to her and President Barack Obamaâ€s mistakes in the Middle East and North Africa that radical Islamic terrorists have been provoked to start a regional war. The latter has led to the current refugee crisis in Europe and undermined the US positions in the region. There are other documents revealed in Hillary Clintonâ€s emails pointing to the mistakes made by Obama administration and Hillaryâ€s State Department in 2012. Under the declassified case number F-2014-20439, Doc No. C05794498, we can find Hillary Clintonâ€s written statements proving that the decision to destroy Syria was also made after misreading the current geostrategic situation in the region. The mistake that then State Secretary Hillary Clinton had made was considering Iran to be using Syria as a transit point for training and logistic support of Hezbollah. Quite mistakenly, Hillary Clinton imagined that in order to cut Hezbollah in Lebanon off from its Iranian sponsor they should destroy Syria. Unqualified and disoriented, Hillary Clinton decided to improve relations with Israel by removing Bashar Assad from power. Erroneously assuming that, with Bashar Assad gone, Iran would no longer be able to threaten Israel through its proxies in Syria. In return, Hillary Clinton hoped that it would make it possible for the US and Israel to agree on their policies toward Iran's nuclear program. Thus Hillary Clinton decided to destroy Syria so that the White House could ease the tensions that had developed with Israel and make Iran comply with the US demands. As we know, nothing of Hillary Clintonâ€s plans has happened, except the destruction of Syria and hundreds of thousands of civilians dead and millions of Syrian refugees flooding Europe and North America.
