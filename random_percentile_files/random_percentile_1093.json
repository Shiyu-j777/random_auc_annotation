He's already been found not guilty of that, and under Double Jeopardy he can't be tried for it again. He's looking at jail time for parole violation. His parents will buy a judge, he will get 10 years in Club Fed, where he will be swimming and playing basketball with judges, bankers, corporate lawyers, and he'll be home in 4 years. I stand by what I said. Do something that will rub his nose in what he's done. Freeze his assets, make him sleep in a hovel and work daily with impoverished people who are watching their sick kids die. Maybe he'll have a change of heart and maybe he won't.
