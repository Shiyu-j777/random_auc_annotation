The Democratic Party, CNN, MSNBC, FOX News? Although there have been some people that have committed suicide, just as Doctors, Lawyers or any walk of life. That does not mean all people are suicidal. Nor are all men or women crazy. Your comment about a gun being dangerous in the house tells most of us that grew up around guns that you have no clue. I grew up around guns during a time when one could order guns from a catalog, mail order. A time when guns were stored in open glass cases without locks. We learned not only how to use them, we learned to respect them and always treat them as if they were loaded, a time when many of us used them to feed our families. The second amendment was instituted by our founding fathers to protect one from intruders, but it was primarily to protect us against tyrant invaders, foreign and domestic. Do I think I could take on an army all by myself? No, I do not. However you seem to be out of touch with the reality that there are millions of patriots and people that took an oath to uphold the constitution of our nation. So when you ask if I alone could defend against an army? There is an army numbering in the millions that will be standing with me. So, you are the one that needs to understand and see the whole picture. There was prohibition, did that work? The powers that be could never stop the production of liquor. There has been laws to stop marijuana, was that successful? Absolutely not. There are laws to stop moonshine and that's also been going on for centuries, has that stopped? No! So don't be ignorant about guns and gun control. It isn't about gun control and never has been, it's about people control. You've been listening to too many stories and propaganda. There are far more people saved by legal concealed carry people than you know. The media will never report those saved by those that legally carry weapons. Laugh all you want that tell all of us either In law enforcement or military the ignorance behind your statements. I will only agree with you on one point. We need better ways to keep the criminals from obtaining guns. Then again there was recently an attack in a mall by a deranged man using a knife and he was finally stopped by a legal gun. So what are we going to do, restrict all knifes? Common sense appears to be sadly lacking with many. I'm sure that if the SHTF you'd be one of those sitting down too afraid to pick up a firearm, so I suggest you take a seat and let those of us willing to defend your right to the first amendment and keep quiet till then.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9964,"user_ideo":0.3197,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.94,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":817},{"user_id":10211763734155186,"comment_id":891362030956852,"date":"2015-07-18","message":"We just gave 150 billion to a guy who hangs gay men and pledges death to America daily.
