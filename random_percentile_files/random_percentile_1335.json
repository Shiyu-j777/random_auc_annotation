So when two black holes collide, you just get one, bigger black hole. You can think of it as the larger one absorbing the smaller, but unless there's a huge size difference, it's more of a mutual event. The energy calculations are due to the way mass/energy is released upon crossing the event horizon, I believe. When matter crosses the event horizon, some of it flashes away as high energy waves; if you have two /massive/ objects colliding, a lot of energy would be released. As to how the calculated how much energy, I have no idea. They have years of higher math, I have one.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0914,"user_ideo":-0.4706,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.18,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1335},{"user_id":10204928902501604,"comment_id":945746318794123,"date":"2015-08-21","message":"GoTrump","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.5459,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.99,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":1335},{"comment_id":10153981117903067,"date":"2016-10-06","message":"So handy, oh well bring on the big house","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7574,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.7,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":1335}]
