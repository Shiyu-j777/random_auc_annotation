The one I loved was that, â€œTrump is arrogant.â€ My friend questioned if one man could make â€œthat much difference in the world today.â€ To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, â€œReally, what has Trump done?â€ I said, â€œIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family. Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that werenâ€t properly installed using proper law. Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew itâ€”news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect. Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before werenâ€t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, \"\"\"\"Tear down that wall.\"\"\"\" Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her kneesâ€”if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage. Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to â€œliberals.â€ As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that heâ€s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct. What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunkâ€”meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value. In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, â€ At this point, what do you have to lose?â€ We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system? One man has done all of this in one yearâ€”one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything Iâ€ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder weâ€re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. Thatâ€s your right. Just donâ€t ever say heâ€s not effective. That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleighâ€s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise â€¦ and they have collectively failed and miserably. Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchaseâ€”they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing. Now, we have a generation of children who hate America. Americaâ€s problem isnâ€t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans. You can disrespect America all you want. But, itâ€s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because theyâ€re not simply the â€œsilent majorityâ€ as youâ€ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them â€œdeplorables.â€ The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.\"\"\"\" PLEASE : copy and paste,THIS needs to be read and spread!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9991,"user_ideo":0.1808,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":2411},{"user_id":10202163309039724,"comment_id":727419287360200,"date":"2015-12-22","message":"Will not vote for Jeb.
