Obama and Clinton are both Marxists from Columbia university( where marxism first came to be studied in the US from Frankfurt Germany) and they both rose to power through Chicago government. Saul Alinsky ,(communist/marxist) installed a marxist government in Chicago around 1930 during the mafia heyday, and became friends with Clinon later in life. They had a brief relationship together in 1971. What you are seeing right now in America is the marxist \"\"\"\"divide and conquer tactic by fanning the flames of racism.This has been controlled for years, but the time is ripe to shift their plan into action.
