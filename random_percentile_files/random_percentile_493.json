Mets pitchers have to be lights out like they have been. And will need more Daniel MURPHY magic. The royals are way better than the cubs and any other team the Mets have faced so far.

If they werent threatening families of the drivers, If they were peaceful then the police wouldnt have got involved. The miners held the country to ransom countless times. Many a night in the 70's we were without power just because the miners wanted more money and piss what was in your fridge or freezer. Hospitals worked by candlelight. You tossers think thats acceptable? They had the upper hand always. If it wasnt for Maggie we would still be in the ages of power cuts because these fools want and expect more money. These people brought this on themselves. For years the police were spat at, bricks and bottles thrown at them by scum miners. The moment they retaliate (after years of the abuse) you nobs call them for it. And I take it most of you fools want to remain in the EU, so look at the European countries police, how they deal with rioters. They wade in military style, dont have to explain themselves and dont have pansy tw*ts complaining like this. Maybe if we had stayed then our police wouldve had that privilege too.
