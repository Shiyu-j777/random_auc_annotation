Until you experience **discrimination** based on your skin color or gain some serious empathy where you can see the struggles of others without having to physically experience it yourself, no I guess you wouldn't understand why this is so important.

Both Obama and Harriet are exceptional human beings who deserve to be recognized no matter their race. This is not a matter of \"\"\"\"taking over\"\"\"\". This is a matter of you needing to stop seeing their color and believing that should be a reason not to recognize them. To keep them down.
