If you expect Turks to respect the memeory of the Armenian innocents lost, then at the very least acknowledge the deaths of Turks in Anatolia at the hand of Armenian rebels. Both sides lost countless innocents at the hands of murderers. You are asking one side to come to the table, while completely turning a blind eye to the atrocoties of the other. As to the Turkish commentators, mention that muslims were killed by Armenian nationalist rebels in Eastern Anatolia in other threads and see what the Armenian response is. Alternatively if third parties take sides like this, favouring one over the other, without hearing and seing proof from both sides, nothing is ever going to happen to reach a common ground between Armenians and Turks.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0088,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.05,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1347},{"user_id":10210352021387169,"comment_id":10154567464925579,"date":"2016-07-13","message":"Kevin, please consider the virtual disaster it would be to have Donald Trump as President!
