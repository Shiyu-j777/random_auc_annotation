Here is what I have to say to these power brokers et al, or the politicians, false witnesses, Democrats, RINOs, Rich Hollywood wanna be so called actors (that don't hold a candle to stars like Jack Lemon and his era's fellow actors), Mrs. Clinton, and The Wall Street Gang who keep demanding the standing, selected person of the main stream members of the Republican party step down: \"\"\"\"The Question of this year's Presidential election is shall America continue to be a government for the people, and by the people, or should it become controlled by accusers and rich political bosses. Less we forget, under our system of government by political parties two elements, equal in importance, are involved in the exercise of suffrage (elections): one, the making of the ballot; the other, the the casting of the ballot. The right to cast the ballot (if you are a legal US citizen and can prove it--unless a corrupt Supreme Court system intervenes illegally.) is regarded as sacred. The right to make the ballot is equally sacred. No man/women would be willing to delegate his power to vote the ballot at general elections. No man/women would be compelled to delegate his/her power to make his ballot to another person. The current power brokers mentioned above and their followers, by demanding that Mr. Trump step down, are at this very moment on America's left wing media controlled airwaves, and her web pages, giving MR Trump, and his followers the following clear message: Your may elect whichever candidates you please to office, if you will allow \"\"\"\"us\"\"\"\" to select the candidates. These power brokers with their millions of dollars feel they can also afford to say: You may vote any ticket you please so long as you allow us to make all of the tickets (Select the Democrat candidate and select the Republican candidate). I say, if this none Constitutional act does happen this year, the character of the men/women nominated and the influence to which they owe their nomination will determine the character of this American Government for years to come. As a lowly middle class, Patriotic American, I say this is wrong. A presidential election should provide the safeguards for nominating and electing its candidates in this so called Democracy. If History has taught us anything, it's that political machines are a combination with aggregate wealth and corporate power, making the interests of America's citizens and the state subservient to their own selfish ends. In the end I ask (I only know his first name is Ryan.) you the same question I heard a Chief Justice Ryan once said, \"\"\"\"Which shall rule---wealth or mankind; which shall lead---the [money of Wall Street, RINOs, the Clinton clan, and left wing media], intellect, [or what is really considered Democracy in the US Constitution]; who shall fill public stations---educated and patriotic freemen[/free-women], or the feudal servants of corporate power [in America]? In closing, I want to add that if Mr. Trump is pushed out of this election, America will be going in a direction that only has a dead end, because if the majority decision of a the current Republican party is ignored and reversed, if the expressed will of the people is scorned and scorned again---then the popular government fails, then governments of the people, by the people, and for the people will be at and end. I hate to say it, but this year's Presidential election is a mockery of US Democracy because it is no longer being governed by the rules of Democratic Suffrage; therefore, in the eyes of the world, the will of the people in America has perished from the earth. Yours, Reg B Two Stones: Note this post was inspired by using some paraphrasing from a speech by Robert Marion La Follette, 1855-1925.
