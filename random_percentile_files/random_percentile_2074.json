To be honest the status quo of politics these days is what has killed our country. So someone is willing to challenge the status quo and the potentially highest likelihood of voter fraud in American history! If I were in his shoes I'm not sure I would have said anything different because this system is broken, and has been for decades since lobbyists have begun owning Presidents. The political law is there for a reason, and the law allows for a challenge of the results! The media is completely missing the point and focusing on irreverent maybes. I'm so tired of the media, and Fox should be focusing on the true issues and remember that election laws are there for a reason.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9835,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.9,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":2074},{"user_id":10208351868049227,"comment_id":10153588191557629,"date":"2015-09-02","message":"Yup. Put this on the county clerk \"\"\"\"Contact Us\"\"\"\" form: Hello Ms. Davis, Thank you for doing God's work. I am the Reverend B.E. Davis of the First Church of the Sabbath in rural Harford County, Maryland. We are so proud of you. It's about time this country put God's law first instead of the heathen laws of man. We are so glad to hear your story as we'd like to have a demonstration to support the sanctity of marriage. As I am sure you know, the same portions of His word referencing foul homosexuality as a sin also state a wife is to always obey her husband's desires and never to as much as disagree, else face stoning. How delighted we were to find out about you doing the Lord's work, let alone a multi-time divorcee. Please join us in a stoning ceremony. Does tomorrow or Thursday work better for you? Yes, for Jesus, you can demonstrate that His law and love are above man's! While you may suffer severe injury, the eternal blessings are well worth the cost. In advance, thank you! We know all you do to uphold God's law is difficult and you are shunned for it, but it will pay you back tenfold. In His loving name, Rev. B.E.
