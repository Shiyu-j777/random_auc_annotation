I love how you forgot to mention... Fact: After inheriting a terrible recession, the nation's economic recovery under Obama has been the slowest one we've experienced since the 1940s. Fact: With an average GDP growth of 2.1% over the last eight years, Obama will go down as the only President since Herbert Hoover to not preside over a single year that saw an average GDP growth rate of 3%. Fact: Under the President's wonderful health care bill, people are seeing their premiums rise by 25%-50% across the nation. Fact: After promising the American people they could keep their doctors under the ACA, it came to fruition...that they couldn't. Fact: Obamacare spearheaded the attack against all forms of full-time employment thanks to companies hiring workers part-time in order to avoid the costs associated with insuring them under the ACA. Fact: Middle class incomes have DECLINED under President Obama. Fact: President Obama essentially added as much money to our nation's overall \"\"\"\"national debt\"\"\"\" in a mere eight years than the sum of ALL forty-three presidents before him...COMBINED! Fact: Under the Obama/Clinton foreign policy, ISIS took over swaths of Syria and Iraq and is now operating in multiple countries around the world. Fact: After promising to be the most \"\"\"\"transparent administration of all time\"\"\"\" President Obama used the IRS to harass conservative nonprofit groups before lying to the American people about IT, Benghazi, his knowledge about Clinton's use of a private email server, and a host of other issues. Now I know progressives are short on debate skills, which is why they habitually resort to mud-slinging, name-calling and virtually any other attempt to label those with whom they disagree as hateful or racist (again, the reason why you guys lost the last election, because you certainly aren't any good at governing), but in case you're one of those select few liberals that has the ability to absorb factual data, I went ahead and spelled it all out for you above, with facts that are...also...verifiable: , , And for the record, when I mentioned the age-old liberal talking point that it's all \"\"\"\"George Bush's fault\"\"\"\", I was being sarcastic. After eight years and two full terms as President, you no longer reserve the right to blame your predecessor. Even Obama knows that, which is why he hasn't blamed Bush for anything in nearly two years. So the fact that grown adults are on here showing the world that they still suffer from BDS (Bush Derangement Syndrome) eight years after he left office is quite embarassing. Some of you should be ashamed of yourselves.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9986,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.96,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":2138},{"comment_id":10154392792644203,"date":"2016-06-26","message":"That's right, just one more vote for Hillary.
