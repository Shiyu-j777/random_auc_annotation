The media has an interest in the progressive socialist movement, so they try to cover up the horrible past of the Democrat party by saying they \"\"\"\"switched\"\"\"\" sides in the past. The Republican party was founded in 1854 by anti slave activists. The Republican party offered a home to the women's suffrage movement. The Republicans in congress started work on JFK's call for the civil rights act. LBJ, under pressure, asked congress to speed a bill a long, so some Democrats jumped on board to get a bill passed. Democrats are the party of the KKK, Jim Crow, Japanese internment camps, etc. The attempt to rewrite history fails when you study it.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.999,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":1006},{"user_id":1132824553464364,"comment_id":10154482338262098,"date":"2017-02-14","message":"Not again ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1525,"user_ideo":-0.5045,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.25,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1006},{"user_id":1150121088342755,"comment_id":10153519780884087,"date":"2016-02-10","message":"TED CRUZ – “I’m a natural born Citizen because my mother was a natural born Citizen.” – which means, according to Cruz, Marco Rubio is NOT a natural born Citizen, because neither of his parents were US citizens at Marco’s birth.
