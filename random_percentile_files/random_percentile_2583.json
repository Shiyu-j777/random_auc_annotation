These are now preserved for posterity behind sheets of plastic. Who would have guessed that during the lifetime of Elizabeth, fascism would rear it's ugly head again? This time from the nation that helped liberate Europe from The Nazis; the perpetrator from that era (Germany) now the sanctuary for those fleeing war and persecution elsewhere. Not a direct parallel - you can never step in the same river twice - but we live in the post-Nazi world where we've supposed to have learned the lessons of that era and we expect human life and dignity to have much more value. A real stark irony. Now Elizabeth has to play host to this man; a consequence of populist policies that led to The Brexit and the need to pursue trade deals. Trump may not be Hitler, but he is defining a new era of fascism that will forever be synonymous with his name. It's not too late to stop it.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.01,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":2583}]
