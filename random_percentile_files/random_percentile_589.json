Our family voted for Jill stein Jill stein is the only candidate who is willing to honor the 1851 treaty and the only candidate actively participating in the protection of the indigenous people of US and visited the Standing Rock Indian conservation way back in July And Who supports Hillary Clinton ? ï¿½ \"\"\"\"I would say that a majority of people in my circle will vote for Hillary,â€ said neocon and Robert Kagan, the co-founder of the neoconservative think tank Project for the New American Century, Kagan played a leading role in pushing for Americaâ€s unilateral invasion of Iraq and insisted for years afterward that it had turned out great. Retired senior US military pilots are increasingly alarmed that Hillary Clintonâ€s proposal for â€œno-fly zonesâ€ in Syria could lead to a military confrontation with Russia that could escalate to levels that were previously unthinkable in the post-cold war world. The Guardian, Oct 25 Despite opposition from the whitehouse , Clinton insisted on imposing a no fly zone in Syria â€œTo have a no-fly zone you have to take out all of the air defenses, many of which are located in populated areas. So our missiles, even if they are standoff missiles so weâ€re not putting our pilots at riskâ€” youâ€re going to kill alot of Syrians,â€ Clinton admitted. Clinton from 2012 : â€œIt is the strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel's security... \"\"\"\"And \"\"\"\"The best way to help Israel deal with Iran's growing nuclear capability is to help the people of Syria overthrow the regime of Bashar Assad,â€ win. \"\"\"\"Hillary Clinton now says her â€œnumber one priority in Syria is the removal of Bashar al-Assad\"\"\"\" \"\"\"\"n 2008, she said if \"\"\"\" (Iran) foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel, we would be able to totally obliterate them,\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"There will have to be consequences for any violation by Iran and that the nuclear option should not at all be taken of the table. That has been my position consistently.â€ Clinton from 2006 \"\"\"\"I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian Territories. I think that was a big mistake,â€ said Sen. Clinton. â€œAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.â€ Clinton has been an unremitting supporter of Israeli aggression, whenever it occurs. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz described her last year as â€œIsraelâ€s new lawyerâ€ given her sympathetic view of Binyamin Netanyahuâ€s 2014 bombardment of Gaza and even his desire to maintain â€œsecurityâ€ throughout the occupied West Bank #jillnothill #steinbaraka2016 #5percent Actress Susan Sarandon : \"\"\"\"I'm therefore very happy to endorse Jill Stein for the presidency because she does stand for everything I believe in.
