What have they done for the middle class people, we now have 40 million people on food stamps. In six yrs what has the Pres. Done besides Obama care. Obama and his friend Reid stopped everything that came out of the house. More then six hundred bills were tucked away in Reid's desk. This Pres. Is in over his head, he has absolutely no experience in running the country, you would think in Six yrs he would have learned something by now. I am not associated with any political party, I vote for the person that will be best for the people and the country.
