I was a store manager for Starbucks, and depending on the market, baristas start as low as $7.40/hr. They get decent regular hours if they have a good manager. Their shift supervisors can't go above $12/hr in most markets. And they do offer health insurance to part time employees, if they can handle most if not all of their check going to pay those premiums. One thing that Starbucks is really good at is marketing to their employees and consumers that Starbucks is a better employer than any other retailer, which is arguable.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0664,"user_ideo":-0.5477,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.15,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":2561},{"user_id":1206708732694076,"comment_id":10153118481723984,"date":"2015-02-08","message":"Obama apologize!!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9727,"user_ideo":0.7102,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.88,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":2561},{"comment_id":813371712142004,"date":"2016-02-26","message":"Sister, I applaud you for everything you said.
