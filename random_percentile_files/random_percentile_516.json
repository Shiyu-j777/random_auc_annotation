B) We want a desired reaction from the public (e.g., fear) C) we offer our desired solution to the problem; a solution that will always further our goals. In this presentation, I will give you a few examples of this technique in practice; to enlighten you about this technique in the best possible way: Example 1 Let us say I want the ice cream that belongs to a child. I cannot just ask the child, \"\"\"\"can I have your ice cream?\"\"\"\" I know he will most certainly say \"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\". So I use the following technique to manipulate him into wanting to give me his ice cream: Stage 1. I invent a fake problem: \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, a ghost will haunt you in the night\"\"\"\". or \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, God will send you to Hell\"\"\"\" or \"\"\"\"If you dont give me your ice cream, you will be very unlucky\"\"\"\" (ofcourse I know it is not true, but the child doesn't) Stage 2. I get a desired reaction from the child: Fear: \"\"\"\"please save me from this danger\"\"\"\" Stage 3. I now offer the solution to the problem I invented: I will save you from this danger if you give me the ice cream. \"\"\"\"I will talk to God\"\"\"\" or \"\"\"\"I will chase away the Ghost\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: I want the child to give me his ice cream. Example 2 Let us say we want the oil in Iraq. We cannot just say to the countries of the world: \"\"\"\"hey, let us go to iraq and take their oil\"\"\"\". The public as well as the countries of the world will not agree to such a thing. So we use the PRS manipulation technique: Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: We use the media to say: \"\"\"\"Iraq has nuclear weapons and poses a threat to the world\"\"\"\" Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please big brother America, save the world from destruction\"\"\"\" Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"You must let us invade iraq in order to save the world\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: After the countries of the world have agreed to our invasion and occupation of the target country (Iraq), we can then use the occupation as a way to secretly steal oil in the target country. During the occupation, the oil companies - owned by illumicorp members - may secretly fund and even bribe some of the military forces within the occupied areas to kill innocent civilians that get in the way of our plans. The assigned corporations then silently takes possession of the oil within the occupied territory without the world ever knowing about it. Example 3 Objective: We want the oil or opium in Afghanistan Stage 1. Problem: We create a 9/11. We blame 9/11 on Usama Bin Laden in Afghanistan. Stage 2. Desired Reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please America, save us from Usama Bin Laden.\"\"\"\" Stage 3. Solution to the problem we created: The people demand the big brother of the world - America - to step in and invade & occupy Afghanistan. Agenda of the solution: We want the oil a or opium in Afghanistan. Example 4 Let us say we want the people to behave the way we want them to behave. We cannot just say to people: \"\"\"\"Behave the way we want you to behave\"\"\"\". People would not obey us. They would rebel against such a statement. So we use the PRS technique in order to manipulate the public into behaving the way we want them to behave. Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: \"\"\"\"There is an invisible, jealous, vindictive and judgemental God in the sky. If you dont behave, he will send you to a place called Hell.\"\"\"\" Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear / guilt Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"If you behave, we will talk to God and he will forgive you. And do not forget to pay the church tax.\"\"\"\" Agenda behind solution: We want the people to behave the way we want them to behave, and no other way. We want to maintain our dominance and control over the population. Example 5 We use the same technique when we want the public to vote for new laws that give us more control over the people; laws they would normally not vote for had it not beenfor the PRS technique. Let us say we want to introduce a new law that further our control over the population (i.e., more CCTV cameras and surveilance). We cannot just say to the people: \"\"\"\"let us have more cameras so that we can have more control over you\"\"\"\". They will say \"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\". So we have to scare the public into demanding the cameras themselves - democratically -. We use the Problem Reaction Solution Technique: Stage 1. We invent a fake problem: 9/11 Stage 2. We get a desired reaction from the public: Fear: \"\"\"\"please America, save us from the terrorists\"\"\"\" Stage 3. We offer the solution to the problem we created / invented: \"\"\"\"allow us to have more cameras in order to prevent future terrorist attacks within the country\"\"\"\" (The people democratically demand that they are controlled, in order to be protected from the terrorist) Agenda behind solution: We want more cameras and more police control over the people, to further our control over the population. So we have to give the public a valid reason to democratically vote for it.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0391,"user_ideo":-0.2427,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.11,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":516},{"user_id":1403512669665139,"comment_id":1127195213982489,"date":"2016-10-20","message":"Bigly Haiti","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0576,"user_ideo":-0.816,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.14,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":516},{"comment_id":447926982055849,"date":"2015-06-10","message":"all i gotta say if you intensionally try to embarrass your child you don't need to be a parent there are other ways to punish your child honestly all these videos about embarrassing your child then sending them to school commen sense says it just going to end bad for the kid somehow stop following others","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5227,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.55,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":516},{"user_id":1304912756187408,"comment_id":10153438877796491,"date":"2016-01-25","message":"Is it raining purple unicorns in you version of reality?

The one I loved was that, â€œTrump is arrogant.â€ My friend questioned if one man could make â€œthat much difference in the world today.â€ To my friend's credit, she was respectful enough to let me respond when she asked, â€œReally, what has Trump done?â€ I said, â€œIn June of last year, Trump entered the race for president. In just a little over a year, Trump has single handedly defeated the Republican party. He did so thoroughly. In fact, he did so in such a resounding way that the Republican Party now suffers from an identity crisis. He literally dismantled the party. Trump even dismantled and dismissed the brand and value of the Bush family. Trump has Obama petrified that Trump will dismiss programs that werenâ€t properly installed using proper law. Trump has single handedly debunked and disemboweled any value of news media as we knew itâ€”news now suffering from an all-time level of distrust and disrespect. Trump has leaders from all over the world talking about him, whether good or bad. Trust me, powerful men who have been president before werenâ€t liked by the global community. I doubt Mikhail Gorbachev liked Reagan when Reagan said, \"\"\"\"Tear down that wall.\"\"\"\" Trump has expressly disclosed the fraud perpetrated on the American public by Hillary Clinton. He has, quite literally, brought Hillary to her kneesâ€”if you believe that nervous tension and disorders offer physical side effects and damage. Trump has unified the silent majority in a way that should be patently frightening to â€œliberals.â€ As the press accuses Trump of being a house of cards, Trump has proven the press is the real house of cards. He has whipped up the entire establishment into pure panic. Trump has exposed them for who they are and worse, what they are. George Clooney was right when he said Trump draws live news coverage of his podium that heâ€s not yet approached. Thanks, George, you were perfectly correct. What we see as headline news today are actually the last bubbles from the ship that is now sunkâ€”meaning the standard news media, as a propaganda machine, has been exposed. They have no more value. In the same way Trump asked the African-American community this question, I asked my friend, â€ At this point, what do you have to lose?â€ We have mass cop shootings, riots in our streets, ambushed cops, double digit inflation, bombs blowing up in our cities, targeted police, #BLM, a skyrocketing jobless rate, no economic growth, privately owned land being seized by the federal government, the worst racial tension in my lifetime, no God in schools, more abortions than ever, illegal aliens pouring into our country, sick veterans receiving no care, and a debt that doubled in seven years to $19 trillion. Are you really happy with the condition of the current system? One man has done all of this in one yearâ€”one guy, and on his own dime. And with everything Iâ€ve written above, you believe Trump hasn't done anything? You claim that you are afraid of Donald Trump? No wonder weâ€re in trouble. You can say that Trump is a lousy presidential candidate. Thatâ€s your right. Just donâ€t ever say heâ€s not effective. That Megan Kelly, FOX News, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, Rachel Maddow, the Huffington Post, the New York Times, Raleighâ€s News and Observer, the AP, Don Lemon, Jake Tapper, and many more, failed to implement their collectively orchestrated lie on the American people against Trump, is actually a massive testament to Trump. The press colluded pure propaganda to accomplish his demise â€¦ and they have collectively failed and miserably. Here's just one example of how badly America is injured right now. There are high school football players on their knees during the national anthem simply because the press used as propaganda to program those kids to do that very thing. But, these kids are mimicking NFL stars the same way the same kids chooses which brand of football shoe to purchaseâ€”they're overtly brain-washed to do that very thing. Now, we have a generation of children who hate America. Americaâ€s problem isnâ€t that little children are on their knee in collective disrespect of America. Our problem is that America is on her knee from collective disrespect by Americans. You can disrespect America all you want. But, itâ€s high-time you respect the silent majority. Because theyâ€re not simply the â€œsilent majorityâ€ as youâ€ve been trained to believe when Hillary calls them â€œdeplorables.â€ The fact is, they are simply the majority. And now they're no longer silent either. Donald Trump changed all of that, single-handedly and within one year.\"\"\"\" PLEASE : copy and paste,THIS needs to be read and spread!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9991,"user_ideo":0.1808,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.97,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":516},{"user_id":10208700077013230,"comment_id":10156509411880500,"date":"2016-02-05","message":"Jann you must be an ignorant, wrong wing, bigot!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0738,"user_ideo":-0.7573,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.16,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":516},{"comment_id":10153537541201509,"date":"2015-04-07","message":"I want to touch a white people skin see what it feel like","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1413,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.24,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":516},{"user_id":10206854390097662,"comment_id":10153089436069091,"date":"2015-07-17","message":"Exactly WHY is he/she being honored ?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8686,"user_ideo":-0.0362,"ideology_label":0,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.77,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":516},{"comment_id":10153835227336336,"date":"2015-11-14","message":"#pray_for_palastine","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0852,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.17,"percentile":"1-20 percentile","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":516},{"user_id":1151115424945791,"comment_id":662506533939925,"date":"2015-09-19","message":"I am sick of Megyn Kelly.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9884,"user_ideo":0.8474,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.91,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":516},{"user_id":10154375283307095,"comment_id":10154390476566636,"date":"2017-01-14","message":"The \"\"\"\"International law\"\"\"\" referred to is not written down in any language anywhere. I challenge you to quote this law. If you are so sure that ¡°Palestine , the country, goes back through most of recorded history, I expect you to be able to answer a few basic questions about that country of Palestine :1) When was it founded and by whom? 2) What were its borders? 3) What was its capital? 4) What were its major cities? 5) What constituted the basis of its economy? 6) What was its form of government? 7) Can you name at least one Palestinian leader before Arafat? 8) Was Palestine ever recognized by a country whose existence, at that time or now, leaves no room for interpretation? 9) What was the language of the country of Palestine ? 10) What was the prevalent religion of the country of Palestine ? 11) What was the name of its currency? Choose any date in history and tell what was the approximate exchange rate of the Palestinian monetary unit against the US dollar, German mark, GB pound, Japanese yen, or Chinese yuan on that date. And, finally, since there is no such country today, what caused its demise and when did it occur? You are lamenting the ¡°low sinking¡± of a ¡°once proud¡± nation. Please tell me, when exactly was that ¡°nation¡± proud and what was it so proud of? And here is the least sarcastic question of all: If the people you mistakenly call ¡°Palestinians¡± are anything but generic Arabs collected from all over or thrown out of the Arab world, if they really have a genuine ethnic identity that gives them right for self-determination, why did they never try to become independent until Arabs suffered their devastating defeat in the Six Day War? I hope you avoid the temptation to trace the modern day ¡°Palestinians¡± to the Biblical Philistines: substituting etymology for history won¡¯t work here. The truth should be obvious to everyone who wants to know it. Arab countries have never abandoned the dream of destroying Israel ; they still cherish it today. Having time and again failed to achieve their evil goal with military means, they decided to fight Israel by proxy.

The Service flag, also called the Blue Star Flag, was designed and patented by WWI Army Captain Robert L. Queisser of the 5th Ohio Infantry who had two sons serving on the front line. The flag quickly became the unofficial symbol of a child in service. President Wilson became part of this history when in 1918 he approved a suggestion made by the Women's Committee of the Council of National Defenses that mothers who had lost a child serving in the war wear a gold gilt star on the traditional black mourning arm band. This led to the tradition of covering the blue star with a gold star on the Service flag to indicate that the service member has died. During WWII the practice of displaying the Service flag became much more widespread. Most flags were hand made by mothers across the nation. One of the most famous flags was that of the five Sullivan brothers who all perished on the U.S.S. Juneau. The Blue Star Mothers was founded as a Veteran Service Organization and was part of a movement to provide care packages to military members serving overseas and also provided assistance to families who encountered hardships as a result of their son or husband serving in the war. In 1960 Congress chartered the Blue Star Mothers of America as a Veterans Service Organization and in 1966, the Department of Defense revised the specifications for design, manufacture and display of the Service flag. The Department of Defense specifies that family members authorized to display the flag include the wife, husband, mother, father, stepmother or father, parent through adoption, foster parents, children, stepchildren, children through adoption, brothers, sisters and half brothers or sisters of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States. The flag should be displayed in a window of the residence of persons authorized. The Service flag may also be displayed by an organization to honor the members of that organization serving during a period of war or hostilities. The Service Flag is an indoor flag and should be flown facing out from the front window of the home or organization. If the U.S. flag is also displayed with the Service flag, the U.S. flag should be of equal or greater proportions and should take the place of honor above the Service flag. Each blue star on the flag represents a service member in active duty. A gold star is displayed if a service member is killed in action or dies in service. If several stars are displayed by one family the gold star takes the honor of being placed at the top. The gold star should be slightly smaller than the blue star to create a blue border surrounding the gold star. Display of a Service Star Banner is done during times of war. Once again families are displaying banners at home.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5669,"user_ideo":0.8257,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.58,"percentile":"21-80 percentile","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":516},{"user_id":10206944305110650,"comment_id":10153369635370090,"date":"2015-07-11","message":"I am very picky about what Republican I will support.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9616,"user_ideo":0.8352,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"partisan","split":0.86,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":516},{"comment_id":1231753356842886,"date":"2016-06-23","message":"I'm in California, give me an address and I will properly and safely relocate these vile devices into their own \"\"\"\"safe space\"\"\"\" lol.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9628,"partisan_type":"no_info","split":0.86,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":516}]
