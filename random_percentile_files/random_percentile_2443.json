DOW is at record level. Canada and Mexico have announced they are willing to renegotiate NAFTA with the US. It's only been two days.......Bless those who put Trump in office.Small groups of people have been marched the streets of American cities to protest the results of a free and fair election. The scene on college campuses around America has been even more absurd with students staging \"\"\"\"cry-ins\"\"\"\" and demanding that classes be postponed so they have time to grieve. It's all so thoroughly embarrassing. And I say that especially as a member of this generation. What we're witnessing are nothing more than massive, organized temper tantrums. And that's the nicest way to put it. If thousands of white conservatives had marched in protest of Obama's election, I have no doubt that the media would paint it as a violent, racist insurrection. I won't go that far in this case, but it is a troubling display all the same. The protesters insist that Trump is \"\"\"\"not their president\"\"\"\" and he's \"\"\"\"got to go\"\"\"\" because he's a racist bigot and so are his supporters. But here's the newsflash for these confused young people: He IS your president. And no, he doesn't \"\"\"\"have to go.\"\"\"\" He won the election. It's over. That's how this works. The irony here is that Democrat voter turnout was down significantly this year. Hillary will finish with about 7 million fewer votes than Obama. Trump will finish with fewer votes than any Republican presidential candidate in the last 20 years. What that means is that, most likely, if these kids had mobilized like this a day earlier, they very likely would have won the election. Instead, many of them stayed home and waited until they lost to suddenly decide that they can't tolerate the notion of a Trump presidency. Lazy and entitled. Fulfilling every negative stereotype of my generation. What this really comes down to is that Millennials -- most of them anyway -- just lost a presidential election for the first time. And they can't handle it. And this is the result. And it's truly embarrassing:","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9936,"user_ideo":0.0445,"ideology_label":1,"partisan_type":"moderate","split":0.93,"percentile":"81-100 percentile","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":2443},{"user_id":1412520588762006,"comment_id":10154135184577115,"date":"2017-01-31","message":"Is London Muslim country?
