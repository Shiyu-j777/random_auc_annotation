Again, dunno if that's what happened but that's the rumors. We do not know if this woman attacked him from behind. How about we wait to hear this guys side of the story instead of only a fraction of the story? \"\"\"\"Normal people don't act out in a violent way like petulant children.\"\"\"\" Normal people wouldn't attack someone without knowing they would get attacked in return. If a woman physically attacks a man in any way he has every right to defend himself how he feels is necessary. Oh and by lumping trump supporters into a category of deplorable makes you one of Hillary's deplorable supporters.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.981,"user_ideo":0.2698,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":3},{"user_id":10209005478566489,"comment_id":1165016263538844,"date":"2015-11-19","message":"seems to be the case Joanne.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3057,"user_ideo":-0.7605,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":4},{"user_id":967074440103744,"comment_id":10153870943769749,"date":"2015-12-29","message":"I just did actually, there isn't a story of such since 2002....and it says there was no evidence just speculation, and if it's common knowledge how come you're the only person to mention it?

We have real problems to deal with - like Homeland Security. Look what's happening in the world - ISIS is terrorizing every nation! Their racial issues are on them at this point. They haven't the facts to even back them up. They have blood on their hands! They should be arrested by the hundred at this point, not applauded or appeased. Here are some facts: An African-American Harvard Economist, Roland G. Frye, Jr., just published findings that there is no racial differences between the deadly shootings of whites and blacks by law enforcement in America. He began his study because he was angered by black men being shot by white cops. But his study surprisingly found that police officers use deadly force when they perceive a threat, regardless of skin color. This data undercuts the entire BLM's argument. He summarized by stating \"\"\"\"Yes, there are some instances of criminal acts, but they are far and in between,\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"they are not disproportionate by race.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9948,"user_ideo":0.7061,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":6},{"user_id":10206638407868491,"comment_id":10153840444593067,"date":"2016-08-13","message":"Arie Kachler A Napoles Virgüez you guys called, Amazon is taking over the world","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0521,"user_ideo":-0.515,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":7},{"user_id":1245104908842068,"comment_id":10153613420374586,"date":"2015-09-04","message":"Enjoy this amazing encounter with Killer Whales in the REAL Seaworld","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1285,"user_ideo":0.594,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":8},{"user_id":1401246179904169,"comment_id":10156062237230354,"date":"2015-08-26","message":"glad you're dead asshole! lost your job because you suck.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4901,"user_ideo":0.8056,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":9},{"user_id":1088564344565986,"comment_id":10154126320304060,"date":"2016-04-09","message":"Brazil also needs a new Congress, given its tainting by corruption.
