As a recent study conducted by the The Finnish Institute of International Affairs has demonstrated over the past few years, Russia has exerted considerable energy to influence European public opinion by using strategic deception that aims at altering of the target audienceâ€s perception of reality to secure strategic objectives. While Ukraine is still at the center of Russian propaganda efforts, issues such as the migrant crisis and the future of the European Union have been manipulated by Russian media to influence both domestic and foreign audiences. As pointed out by the NATO Strategic Communication Center of Excellence, Russian information warfare is not static. The strategies of Russian information war constantly change, and its tools vary from mainstream media to social network trolling. Studying and countering the Russian cyber troll army is a challenging task that has been undertaken not only by NATO research centers, but also by civil society activists in the Baltics. Governments face the question of whether to limit the diffusion of Russian state media.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0551,"user_ideo":-0.3609,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":16},{"user_id":1055552864480225,"comment_id":10153239653512061,"date":"2015-11-20","message":"So Canadian.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1699,"user_ideo":-0.5103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":17},{"user_id":1111555482257290,"comment_id":1117949188229654,"date":"2016-02-06","message":"Be glad when the pigs get a taste of their own medicine.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1601,"user_ideo":-0.1048,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":18},{"user_id":1148858968512538,"comment_id":458859040985850,"date":"2016-02-08","message":"Jeffrey Eaton why are you still here?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2532,"user_ideo":0.6259,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":19},{"user_id":987763301321631,"comment_id":1177272108959810,"date":"2016-07-14","message":"Not many know that.
