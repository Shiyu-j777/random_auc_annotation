If your so positive that what you are saying is credible then give us some verifiable proof! As for voting for a third party/write in that cannot possibly win, you and all the other third party/write in voters keep talking aboout making a statement, well I'd like to know how you consider it making a statement when your vote won't even mean an iota of a statement, why, because no one will ever know you voted since there will be no recognition of anyone other than the top two canidates... So that means your vote was wasted on a statement that nobody heard or cared about!

It must be much harder for them to serve because they are seeing what violence and injustice does. I'm not complaining about the Corps, I'm just saying they have a different world view. And distrust for the government has increased. After all there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after all. Nothing in Afghanistan can ever truly be won. 9/11 happened somehow while we're out involved in something on at least every continent... Just feel bad for millenials going through this whole women in combat roles transition. Old Corps grunts and anyone with a CAR will fight it to the death. The Corps is trying to recruit millenials but there's a price to pay. Stress cards, womens empowerment, LGTBQ friendly, transgender friendly. It's a new world my friends. Maybe it's a step in a better direction.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0347,"user_ideo":-0.2735,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1399},{"user_id":1233781373313487,"comment_id":1783663031919880,"date":"2016-05-09","message":"When the Tea Party begins demanding cuts to school lunch programs, THAT, is what you get","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0026,"user_ideo":-0.734,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":160,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1399},{"user_id":1732229983716265,"comment_id":1164077646966039,"date":"2015-11-17","message":"go to hell Anderson","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9431,"user_ideo":-0.8062,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1399},{"user_id":10205143879955389,"comment_id":10152625954730671,"date":"2015-02-03","message":"WOW HORRIBLE","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5286,"user_ideo":0.7367,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1399},{"user_id":1078023732290266,"comment_id":1049532241753914,"date":"2015-06-04","message":"Don't do that shit.
