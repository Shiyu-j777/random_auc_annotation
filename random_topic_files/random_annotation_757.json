Corporations who donate to Hillary, donate to republicans as well. To them it's all the same because when you own the coin, it doesn't matter which side is facing up. Sanders wasn't even a serious contender until late last year and his support only grows. He currently polls higher than GOP candidates and is either above or close to Hillary in the polls. Sanders has inspired many many people to get out and vote. If he doesn't get the nomination, the GOP will win. We witnessed this when bush was elected twice because the DNC couldn't get enough support from the people.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0006,"user_ideo":-0.7543,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":757},{"user_id":10207066160876905,"comment_id":996206177086907,"date":"2015-04-15","message":"@ : The fact that you EXPECT a tip is the problem.
