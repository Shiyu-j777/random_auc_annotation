They are too small to understand you need to sit here- by human nature they are curious and want to run around. So we for the most part stay home or go to child friendly places- we don't eat junk so no chucke cheese or McDonald's- but we have a bag of toys, iPad, coloring and snacks if food is taking long. I agree with some comments that how do you know if a child has a disability? Should we not be a tolerable society? Just because we are parents doesn't mean we shouldn't be allowed to go out in to the public- restaurants, cafe or etc. I find it sad that so many people are quick to be hateful. I know I try my best as a parent when out in public but they are children at the end of the day- they won't sit and be quiet. I think many of you forgot that you were all children once not animals to be locked away somewhere until adulthood hit.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0824,"user_ideo":-0.3499,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":160,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1230},{"user_id":1281408968560542,"comment_id":1835733119980971,"date":"2016-11-27","message":"He the one who needs to be investigated he used his foundation as a personal piggy bank just like he'll do with this country.
