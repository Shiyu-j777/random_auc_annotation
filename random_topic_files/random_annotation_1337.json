Really grasping at straws to try and read into what Brady said. Zero mention of White House, President, or boycotting. Again, this media outlet is making it into something it may not be. Brady has not released a statement AGAINST his teammates, and probably won't. This is what makes him a great leader and teammate. Team 1st. That's the New England Patriot way. Poor attempt at dramatic drivel American news. Although, per the law of averages, someone will believe this, thereby attributing drama to Brady.
