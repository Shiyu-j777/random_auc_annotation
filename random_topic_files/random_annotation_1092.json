They r beating these workers and attacking their families. I live here. U have no idea! It's not even their land!! The line never touches their land at all. Also, u should know that 1 judge has given a restraining order AGAINST THE protesters due to violence. They aren't even supposed to be near those workers at all! Another judge has already ruled that the workers r within legal bounds and can continue work. Congress is now investigating the protesters as well because they r accepting illegal funding to bring in more people!!! The protests got mad about the ruling so they broke through fencing and beat the security guards and their dogs so bad that they had to be hospitalized!! Once again... it was PRIVATE LAND!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9294,"user_ideo":0.3157,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1092},{"user_id":10210360045063864,"comment_id":10153292092356770,"date":"2016-02-11","message":"time for Marco Rubio to take this looser out of the race.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8634,"user_ideo":0.8497,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1092},{"user_id":10210248021381335,"comment_id":10154523435789641,"date":"2016-09-27","message":"Look it up on YouTube, no one makes Trump look bad, he does that on his own.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1107,"user_ideo":-0.2707,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1092},{"user_id":10210158975280559,"comment_id":1046240285388228,"date":"2015-07-09","message":"so you go back and bomb the fukers kill there kids poison gas the neighborhood saran or poor mans mustered gas ..long as nigers die","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4759,"user_ideo":0.3511,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":261,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1092},{"user_id":1683457358645897,"comment_id":10153627993551770,"date":"2016-07-12","message":"Put his dumb butt in charge?

Libertarianism isn't really an ideology either. Libertarians want (or should want) the greatest amount of personal freedom possible without resorting to official anarchy. Since there is no way to tell how much freedom there can be in any social system until we try it out in the real world, it's more of an experiment than a plan. The US Constitution was such an experiment, and history tells us how it worked out ... its strengths and weaknesses. All most of us know at this point in history is that personal freedom and responsibility formally are about as low as they've been since the Constitution was ratified.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4788,"user_ideo":0.3948,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":100,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1092},{"user_id":1479214478762708,"comment_id":569761936555912,"date":"2016-11-23","message":"She is right.
