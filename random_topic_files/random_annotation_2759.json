Maybe you need to read what you just said to me! They are saying he killed himself and on top of it painted him as a hero,now they are saying he is all these bad things or was,cops can be dirty you you feel me? They do illegal stuff all the time and if him and others on the force we're dealing in criminal activity and look by this picture he looks like a thug,never judge a person by the looks or what the media puts out,maybe he knew to much,is what I am saying maybe he was actually murdered. And what does me owning a gun have to do with me wondering if it were foul play? Is your family member on this police force or are you looking for a argument or a race comment? If not go back to school and learn what words mean because darling you just misinterpreted what I said all the down the line. I do not support criminals and I do not support cops being brutal and I sure as hell do not support people trying to make good cops look bad,and I do not support arguing over bs and arguing over something someone read all wrong. I know what comment you are looking for here and not gonna get it,go sit on your soap box and stop trolling.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.747,"user_ideo":0.0034,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":14},{"user_id":10102093256813864,"comment_id":10153837508091800,"date":"2016-01-15","message":"I'm assuming you were making a joke Tim, because withdrawing from Iraq and utilizing drone strikes has no correlation to a stronger military. If anything...between the force reductions, sustained ops tempo, ousting of an unprecedented # of senior leaders, softer/gentler training tactics, reduced training standards, conversion to civilian contractors in place of military bodies, our military is struggling. We might spend a lot of money, but the recent political oversight from congress and a president who have no clue how to run a military has severely weakened its ability. Less than 20% of congress has ever served, how would they know what's best for the military?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9887,"user_ideo":0.2682,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":15},{"user_id":10102858325329936,"comment_id":10153149455268690,"date":"2015-01-31","message":"Cornelious Brister...@Elinda Taylor Lucious Powell","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1097,"user_ideo":-0.4836,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":16},{"user_id":1045740842218604,"comment_id":997113913727022,"date":"2016-11-18","message":"Lets watch the USA find a reason to import democracy to Bolivia through a military intervention...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0278,"user_ideo":-0.6294,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":17},{"user_id":559949084211990,"comment_id":714282172073190,"date":"2016-12-23","message":"That's so perfect","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2949,"user_ideo":0.0772,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":18},{"user_id":1145658685505989,"comment_id":843244739107467,"date":"2015-10-02","message":"I predict more gun violence.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0616,"user_ideo":-0.687,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":19},{"user_id":998926236871849,"comment_id":10157889968700347,"date":"2016-11-09","message":"President No. 45 of USA, TRUMP wins, congratulation from Benghazi to president Trump and USA people....Start packing your bags.
