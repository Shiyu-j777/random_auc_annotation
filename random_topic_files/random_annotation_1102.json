I see yo went to Yale so you feel like an elitist who would agree with all freedom of press. However, the liberal playbook now thinks it's great to have freedom of press unless you don't like what their saying. Then it should be censored. Freedom of press goes both ways. There are no go zones in my hometown that are controlled by black gangs. If you don't believe me come and bring your kids with you and you can be free to walk through these parts of town. Chances are you won't make it without injury. My family is from Great Britain. I know for a fact there are Sharia enforcers that converge streets enforcing their beliefs. I was a soldier who made it through combat and worked for the red cross. I made it through combat but not the American ghetto while I was there helping those same people who attacked me. I have one lung, no intestines and half a liver. Disnt even make the newspaper. If I was black, well Don Lemon would still be there with Al Sharpston. You don't think there's a political motivation there? Would or did cover me. I was beaten for 2 hours before I was shot. Freedom of press goes both ways. I guarantee there are places in France and that are no go zones for Infidels. If they can show my pope in a condom is that not slander. The fact is if you knew Fox was telling the truth you would still want to shut Fox up bc you disagree. Hippies from the 60s would be ashamed.
