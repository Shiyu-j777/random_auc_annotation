If anything...between the force reductions, sustained ops tempo, ousting of an unprecedented # of senior leaders, softer/gentler training tactics, reduced training standards, conversion to civilian contractors in place of military bodies, our military is struggling. We might spend a lot of money, but the recent political oversight from congress and a president who have no clue how to run a military has severely weakened its ability. Less than 20% of congress has ever served, how would they know what's best for the military?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9887,"user_ideo":0.2682,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":14},{"user_id":1235642439829223,"comment_id":726679454189299,"date":"2016-01-08","message":"I tried to bring up the article, but it won't come up.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3223,"user_ideo":0.8499,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":15},{"user_id":10154387558252789,"comment_id":10153763205476162,"date":"2015-10-03","message":"She and I would've had a face to face and I pretty sure she would've been been paying me for her action.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4578,"user_ideo":-0.5039,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":16},{"user_id":1652303985097021,"comment_id":10153543950726623,"date":"2016-04-21","message":"Was Hulk Hogan in there too?
