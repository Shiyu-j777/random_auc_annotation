What ever happened to 2-source verification. Anything less equates to media bias and false representation. Mainly, the Liberal Media has failed to honestly critique Democratic candidates at least on an equal basis as they do Republican candidates. The Liberal media engages in character assassination and they are doing it to hundreds of decent people across this country who totally reject their political beliefs. Not only is the Liberal Media complacent in character assassination...they are aiding and abetting in it's conduct. Since I disdain everything they stand for, I expect them to continue on with their assaults on Republican candidates across the country. If people want to listen to an believe the trash they spout, then by all means do so. But the Democratic Party sucks...anyone that is one of them and engaged in character assassination sucks, and I for one will never vote for even one Democrat because of it. When they engage in character assassination using deceit and lies...that is what their subjects are voting for to represent them in our government.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.3647,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":3},{"user_id":1059609354130143,"comment_id":10153920404011336,"date":"2015-12-20","message":"At least the idiots didn't throw a flash bang into a playpen with a sleeping baby in it.

Woke up, as I usually do, at 2am to go to the bathroom and kept hearing a \"\"\"\"thump-thump-thump\"\"\"\", startlling me; turns out it was my left arm clanging on the wall, dead as a doornail. I was in the middle of having another stroke! Linda called my son who met us half way to the hospital and received treatment. However, i learned later to NEVER do that - call 911 instead. As soon as they arrive the EMT's begin treatment, forwarding vitals to the hospital, etc. and saves ER admittance time, also. Took 3 days before they'd let me out of bed to take a shower; they agreed I was ripe, lol~","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2261,"user_ideo":-0.6065,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":5},{"user_id":10210223019521094,"comment_id":10152902468394091,"date":"2015-04-24","message":"Awwww ðŸ˜¢that's a true friend ðŸ˜„ðŸ‘","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2105,"user_ideo":-0.26,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":6},{"user_id":10209796870335648,"comment_id":10153565478053690,"date":"2015-07-07","message":"Cool runnings! :D","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2225,"user_ideo":-0.384,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":7},{"user_id":1194646803899056,"comment_id":10153444348616973,"date":"2016-02-05","message":"Lol @ \"\"\"\"educational efforts\"\"\"\"","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2001,"user_ideo":-0.5892,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":8},{"user_id":10154450455038338,"comment_id":10153968873492144,"date":"2016-08-15","message":"He will never be president.
