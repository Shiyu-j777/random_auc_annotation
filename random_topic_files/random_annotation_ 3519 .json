Every single opportunity that a preacher gets to make himself rich off of your tythes, he will take it, and there is nothing that the law will do about it. That opportunity to get rich off of an invisible product is one of the main reasons that religion was invented in the first place. And why do you think that you know Christianity better than anyone else? You are going off of the same book that Benny Hinn goes off of, and other millionaire preachers use to justify skimming. Don't be so sure that you have found the right way. You are basing your opinion off of the same bogus book that they are.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0872,"user_ideo":-0.6258,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":3},{"user_id":1060440824041190,"comment_id":10153134474574607,"date":"2015-09-10","message":"You are exactly right, ! Not every black person is a criminal, in fact I have several friends who are Doctors and professionals. Not all white people are racist. Not all of us think people who aren't white are inferior. However, unfortunately in this country negativity gets the press. The ones of us who exist side by side and work hard, live within the law, and behave accordingly never make the news. It's a shame because just that would begin to heal the rift that has started to grow between the races.

Human chimeras were first discovered with the advent of blood typing when it was found that some people had more than one blood type. Most of them proved to be \"\"\"\"blood chimeras\"\"\"\" -- non-identical twins who shared a blood supply in the uterus. Those who were not twins are thought to have blood cells from a twin that died early in gestation. Twin embryos often share a blood supply in the placenta, allowing blood stem cells to pass from one and settle in the bone marrow of the other.
