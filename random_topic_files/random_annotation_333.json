I speak as a suicide survivor, so I speak from personal experience. If you have never been in a situation that has caused you to seriously consider taking your own life, I can understand that it might be difficult to comprehend that sort of thought process. Headlines are notorious for sensationalizing aspects of stories in order to get readership, and in this case it's clear that the issue of the purse was simply pretext above and beyond the horrible abuse this woman suffered. That being said, even outside of situations of clear abuse, people who are severly depressed can be pushed over the edge by seemingly inocuous events because their minds simply cannot see the situation clearly, and almost everything can seem entirely hopeless. Again, if you have not been there, it can be extremely hard to understand or imagine.
