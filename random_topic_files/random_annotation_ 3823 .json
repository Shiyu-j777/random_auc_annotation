But with that said, everything they said made it look like it was the Patriots that were firing with rifles, when all the shooting was the FBI snipers and cops. It is heartbreaking how low our country has become. How people are not rallying around this to stop the injustices. As to the other folks, sharpton etc of course they will not be there. #1. Those folks are white. #2. They are Obama henchmen and this is an order from Obama to create this situation. He needs the conflict/civil unrest to declare Marshall law. The race baiting is not working because we, the whites, used words not force to fight back. His time in office is getting shorter and he needs to push harder to progress his agenda.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.8434,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":3},{"user_id":10205752968257346,"comment_id":10153091284101037,"date":"2015-02-11","message":"That dude is a EDP!

Donald J. Trump is a Republican, and he doesn't seem to be having trouble with the media. Has anyone noticed that Ted Cruz is ALWAYS looking for someone to blame for his own failures?
