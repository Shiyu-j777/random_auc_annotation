In clubs, stores, you name it. I don't live my life filled with fear and hate. Now if anyone tried to share a stall with me, I'd have a problem. Having them in there looking in the mirror, using a toilet, or washing their hands doesn't bother me at all. How do you expect a person who has changed their physical appearance, a person with breasts and in all appearances is a female, to go into the men's room? Straight men might be more uncomfortable with that and are more prone to assault a trans women than women are. Gay/trans people don't want to hurt or rape your kids. You people need to separate pedophiles from LGBT people. They are not one and the same. My husband likes woman, that doesn't mean he's attracted to little girls too. I like grown men that doesn't mean I'm attracted to little boys. The same goes for LGBT people. Pedophiles are sick and disgusting creatures. They enjoy the suffering and torment of innocent children. They normally lead heterosexual lives. Think about that.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0081,"user_ideo":-0.4162,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1164},{"user_id":1236267536423345,"comment_id":10153903812831051,"date":"2016-07-11","message":"Really nice Dutch oven!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3336,"user_ideo":0.8098,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":225,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1164},{"user_id":658241404339421,"comment_id":1014955238547716,"date":"2015-10-30","message":"I am sorry but this officer has no other choice. This student locked her legs to her desk , made it difficult to grab her. This girl obviously has no respect for her teacher or the officer. This school resource officer goes to work to protect his students. His job is on the line all because some girl could not follow a simple direction. To leave the classroom. When i was growing up you had respect for your elders especially at school. Your there to learn and get a education. This student has a major attitude and thinks she can do whatever she wants. More than likely the girl gets her attitude from her parents or parent. Of course this will turn into a race issue just like 's parents are still making excuses for Michael. Students have rules they must follow. It's not rocket science. I would not be suprised if the girls parents file a lawsuit and they will turn this into a circus. Instead of the parent's admitting their daughter was at fault. You can see from few different videos that the officer was doing his job. Just prior to this innocent. The officer received an award for doing a good job. The school should be ashamed of themselves. Only reason I can see why they released him from his duties was a race issue and didn't want to have a race war. That is so wrong on so many levels. That is teaching that black people are above everyone else. I rather see this girl go to jail for assaulting the officer.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9617,"user_ideo":0.3869,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1164},{"user_id":10154438093656096,"comment_id":10153657741521680,"date":"2016-07-09","message":"One cannot \"\"\"\"win\"\"\"\" a primary when the house is holding 5 aces before a hand is dealt.
