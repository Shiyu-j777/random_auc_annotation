The rule to live by is do unto others as you want them to do unto you. NOT.... Do unto others before they do it to you are others. So looking out for yourselves more than you do others is why we can't get along with each other. If I never car about you and only myself you will get hurt everytime. Is this not how the world is. Hurting others instead of helping others.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6752,"user_ideo":0.0423,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":1},{"user_id":10155920393408644,"comment_id":1507892815897410,"date":"2016-09-21","message":"\"\"\"\"Show of force,\"\"\"\" or better known as the \"\"\"\"I have a bigger dick than you\"\"\"\" strategy.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0124,"user_ideo":-0.4169,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":2},{"user_id":1181194461934604,"comment_id":1273238649394435,"date":"2016-10-25","message":"Matthew Barrows Travis Goss Levi Goss Titus Goss","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2705,"user_ideo":0.5748,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":3},{"user_id":893017334175954,"comment_id":10152502668912377,"date":"2015-01-06","message":"I agree with you. However, not all apples are equal. Sure would be nice to know the carrots came from land that wasn't full of residual pesticides. That the burgers weren't pink slime, that the lettuce hadn't been sprayed with poison and the milk was actually healthy. I don't think vending machines belong in public schools, but if they are water and both chewy and crunchy nutrition bars should be the only options. That should be a district choice though.
