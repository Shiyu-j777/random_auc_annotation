No elementary age kid should be left outside at a freezing bus stop. Period. And definitely not left alone to wait for the bus. If the school notified the parents of how long it was going to be, then the parents should have brought the kids back in the house where there was heat. This feeble attempt to shift responsibility to the school is pathetic. If the school notified me that the bus was running that late my kid would come back in. Again, hope to God you don't have children and if you do I beg the question , would you leave your 5 to 9 year old child outside for an hour when its under 10 degrees? And then attempt (feebly) to shift blame to the school?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2619,"user_ideo":0.6753,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":770},{"user_id":1816984715269791,"comment_id":10153063822196028,"date":"2015-07-06","message":"I didn't say its was a pet I was saying I will take baby in idk the # thank you","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4384,"user_ideo":-0.5448,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":770},{"user_id":10209885786924970,"comment_id":10153806273823525,"date":"2016-07-02","message":"Sad it's wanting freedom","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7622,"user_ideo":0.5099,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":770},{"user_id":1058567450906773,"comment_id":1117756754975425,"date":"2016-10-08","message":"you are so right they can kick trump but at least he has never done anything in the white house","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8591,"user_ideo":0.4023,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":770},{"user_id":10205107550887265,"comment_id":10150658992729999,"date":"2015-09-04","message":"The only truth is that ALL LIVES MATTER","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9002,"user_ideo":0.3631,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":261,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":770},{"user_id":10206768721471900,"comment_id":660677330736993,"date":"2016-02-22","message":"What is wrong with the adults that aren't supporting her?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2041,"user_ideo":0.8129,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":261,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":770},{"user_id":1550933518268413,"comment_id":10154988388620695,"date":"2016-11-30","message":"I told you somebody won lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3501,"user_ideo":-0.3242,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":770},{"user_id":1257288457649313,"comment_id":10152785657781051,"date":"2015-02-11","message":"School needs to keep out of family matters.
