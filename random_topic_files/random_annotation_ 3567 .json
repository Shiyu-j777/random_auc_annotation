The fine print being that 54% of our discretionary spending goes to defense, not 54% of the budget. This is intentionally misleading. Again, only 6% on education is also the section of discretionary spending that the military spending comes from. It's meant to mislead, not grant a more true-to-life picture of what the government spends on education vs. defense. The term government itself is misleading, since it obviously only refers to the Federal government. The entire governmental body (State, Federal, Local) spends more on education than on defense. The federal government budgeted to spend $119.2B on education in 2016. They budgeted $851.8B for defense. These numbers alone tell a much different picture than 54% vs. 6%. Additionally, the federal government budgeted $57.1B in government transfers to state and local bodies for educational spending. So the federal government in total have budgeted roughly $176.3B for education, ~4.4% of the total federal budget. This compares with 21.3% on defense. Where the major difference factors in are in the state and local levels, where most of the educational funding comes from, vs. nothing for defense (since defense is only allowed to be a federal and state expenditure). The state level of government budgeted $1B on defense nationwide. On education, they budgeted $284.2B for education. The local governments budgeted $0 for defense and $604.5B for education. A grand total of $852.8B was budgeted for defense, while a grand total of $950.8B has been budgeted for education. In summary, TOTAL GOVERNMENT involvement changes things drastically, with the budget for defense coming up to 13% of the budget, and education totaling 14.5% of the total budget.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4165,"user_ideo":0.0757,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":14},{"user_id":542697315913938,"comment_id":10153674730643188,"date":"2015-10-02","message":"God be with you,Chris.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9507,"user_ideo":0.8899,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":15},{"user_id":1147655968654550,"comment_id":1586377098058602,"date":"2016-03-19","message":"Hillary doesn't stand for anything except Hillary.
