Unlike Zimbabwe or some other corrupt African governments, the U.S. Federal Election Commission has conducted the Presidential election in a perfect, scientific and systematic manner without any corrupt practice. \"\"\"\"To be clear: The equipment that people vote on is NOT connected to the Internet,\"\"\"\" the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote in an open letter to Congress. \"\"\"\"Vote counting is NEVER done with systems connected to the Internet, and tabulation systems are not networked.\"\"\"\" In sum, Russia has not hacked votes and therefore CIA is bluffing to fool the public. CIA AND OBAMA CIA chief Brennan is a Muslim. He opted to take the oath on a copy of the U.S. Constitution, not on the Bible as every past CIA director, Christian and Jewish, had done. Both Obama and Brennan were shocked by the unexpected victory of Trump and they have now planned to attribute Trump's victory to Russian hacking. The New York Times commented that ¡°in the 67 years since the C.I.A. was founded, few presidents have had as close a bond with their intelligence chiefs as Mr. Obama has forged with Mr. Brennan. So this hoax of Russian hacking is a planned strategy of Obama and Brennen to mislead the public about Trump¡¯s victory.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9907,"user_ideo":-0.1935,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":6},{"user_id":10205196443029825,"comment_id":1805608273051305,"date":"2016-11-10","message":"Well that's the question, what does he just do? And that's all I was really trying to ask. You and I both watched Clinton and Trump speeches without media bias and simply came to different conclusions. You and I both, as well as plenty of other Americans, put in the research to lead us to choose who we voted for as president. I was hoping for more actually related to his business and Trump News than Clinton coming up again. Trump is the president elect so I was wondering about him. Maybe you assume I'm tugging at some strings or something, but I was just looking for more on the business aspect.

Aside from pre-Reagan crap that went down...some of the things he did were terrible. Iran-Contra? So what about Pres. BUSH Sitting like a DOPE and doing nothing for 9 min after twin towers hit. Iraq War fiasco and feeding false info and Intel to ALL Abu-Graib Halliburton FEMA and Hurricane Catrina And Pres. Bush waiting 4 days to send ships to NOLA after. Blackwater and NOLA The fact that Pres. Bush and Dick Chenney committed war crimes and also crimes against humanity by lying about the reasons for war. Maybe Democrats should remember the next time the GOP do something that is really reckless like ignore warnings and intell regarding an eminent terrorist attack given by the outgoing administration .
