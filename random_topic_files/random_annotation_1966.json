Are you serious right now? Are we in high school? Or has this actually become middle school? this is THE WORST bunch of cry babies I've ever seen. First of all- Walmart doesn't close a store because of a rumor (this is not responsible news reporting so lets make this news source know that). Second-- if that store is MAKING MONEY they also won't close a store. How many walmarts across this nation are dry and they still make money. (Let me answer that for you HUNDREDS.) So before you start bashing a retailer that brings more revenue and jobs than most other retailers in that community id say you are a bunch of ungrateful residence.

Over the progress of the impeachment trial,two episodes can define actually what is going on. First episode, one audio record was leaked involving 3 head senators (one of them was involved in Slavery accusation, that was archived later of course). They literally talked about rise up Temer as president, so would be more easily to put breaks on the Lava Jato operation (op that unleashed all the political crisis in the country). This week, days before the senate trial, there was another leak in the investigations, pointing one of the Minister of Supreme Court as another beneficiary from the Petrobras corruption scheme. Summing up, what is happening on Brasil is criminals fighting criminals for power. The Mainstream media keeps moving people around the two main groups: The 'Fora Dilma' supporters and the 'Fora Temer' supporters. Brasil Politics are shit, just like anywhere on the planet. The difference is that we now have a circus to watch.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0348,"user_ideo":-0.4756,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":20}]
