And if the connection doesn't hold, it's wrong to consider mosquitoes (or the Zika they carry) to be a true public health threat.

But to those who think the employer should give him a car, it is not that simple. How many other employees have endured hardships to show up for work everyday, on time. Maybe they didn't walk this far to work but a hardship is a hardship. Cannot just do for one without creating animosity. Also, showing up on time is the expectation of any job. It is not the employers responsibility to get you there.
