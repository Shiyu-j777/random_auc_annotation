If anything...between the force reductions, sustained ops tempo, ousting of an unprecedented # of senior leaders, softer/gentler training tactics, reduced training standards, conversion to civilian contractors in place of military bodies, our military is struggling. We might spend a lot of money, but the recent political oversight from congress and a president who have no clue how to run a military has severely weakened its ability. Less than 20% of congress has ever served, how would they know what's best for the military?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9887,"user_ideo":0.2682,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":4},{"user_id":10208635282252672,"comment_id":648324128679873,"date":"2016-12-24","message":"Merry Christmas from Alabama !!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9332,"user_ideo":0.5705,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":5},{"user_id":10210004007199535,"comment_id":10154229075071341,"date":"2016-07-11","message":"contrary to what you want to believe, it is not considered a historical atlas.

I'm not a magical elf wizard but Skyrim was still worth 300 hours. You don't play a game watching a character, you are the character. You are automatically represented simply by playing.
