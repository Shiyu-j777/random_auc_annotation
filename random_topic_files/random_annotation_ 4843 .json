Do you what it's like to be a public servant?! To go to work everyday hoping to God when they call 911 they actually need help and aren't setting you up. To work on an ambulance, completely unarmed I add, and knock on a door to help a total stranger. Or to be a police officer and answer a calm to defend or protect people you've never met? If you don't know what it's like to be a public servant, furthermore a police officer, shut up and stop telling them how to do there jobs. I am not saying their all perfect but then again no one is. So I'll reiterate my previous statement. If you have nothing more intelligent to say than \"\"\"\"that's what you get\"\"\"\" in support of a man who killed 5 cops who had NOTHING to do with previous cop vs civilian situations than shut your ignorant mouth and stop spewing senseless hatred. You talk about uniting, but then you spew moronic, counterproductive, and misplaced anger and hatred. Before you can help unite anyone you first need to step back and think before you type next time","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7163,"user_ideo":0.5006,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":3},{"user_id":10207012163413560,"comment_id":10153800940265779,"date":"2016-09-16","message":"I watched it last night.
