In fact, the vast majority of scientific nutritional studies; you know, the kind without a preconceived agenda to confirm; show that the majority of humans thrive on a mixed omnivore diet. Small amounts of animal protein mixed with fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Absolutist claims are ludicrous and don't stand up to non dogmatic scrutiny. I agree we need to fix the problems, hold the industry to exceedingly higher standards of humane treatment. And that can be done in economically feasible ways as the research of Temple Grandin has ably demonstrated. You'd have half the world end up starving to death, between your dogmatic anti meat stance and your close allies in the anti gmo camp. With our changing planet we need to use all our collective intelligence to come up with real solutions for the 7 billion people on the planet right now. And the problem with genetically modified crops isn't the genetic modifications, but the corporate patents governments grant. This research and deployment should be government funded and freely distributed, just as Dr. Salk gave freely the patent for the polio vaccine.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0052,"user_ideo":-0.7714,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":5,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":776},{"user_id":313754285642968,"comment_id":10154906880776756,"date":"2016-10-28","message":"Wow, people don't usually make comments that reveal a crusty layer of scumbaggery underneath all the stupid.
