Yet another 'person of color' gets off for bad behavior and child endangerment. There was a three foot wall in front of the cage; the kid could NOT have climbed up without help. She PUT him there while she attended the 4 other kids there with her. Make no mistake, the gorilla was a wild animal. Ever play with a dog? Friendly as it might be, you give it a toy, and it will play, tease, run, but won't let you get it. This gorilla, while some thought it was 'protecting' the child, was actually acting in a 'possessive' manner, and if anyone would have tried to take the child away, that gorilla would have dragged, thrown, ripped apart that little kid with very little effort. The mother is clearly at fault. Results? A beautiful animal is killed, and the idiot mother has no charges against her. RE-diculous! But, it would be racist to file charges.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9503,"user_ideo":0.7739,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":468},{"user_id":1776845422600080,"comment_id":10153512340236130,"date":"2015-12-02","message":"So When a Christian white male kills people in the USA WHO is to blame?
