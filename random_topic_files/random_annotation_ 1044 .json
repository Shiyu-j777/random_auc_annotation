I also had a fraternal twin brother. We would of been triplets. Weird stuff... * Chimera: In medicine, a person composed of two genetically distinct types of cells. Human chimeras were first discovered with the advent of blood typing when it was found that some people had more than one blood type. Most of them proved to be \"\"\"\"blood chimeras\"\"\"\" -- non-identical twins who shared a blood supply in the uterus. Those who were not twins are thought to have blood cells from a twin that died early in gestation. Twin embryos often share a blood supply in the placenta, allowing blood stem cells to pass from one and settle in the bone marrow of the other. About 8% of non-identical twin pairs are chimeras.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2459,"user_ideo":-0.1835,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":3},{"user_id":1736737763250828,"comment_id":10153513534986509,"date":"2015-03-30","message":"Oh wow.
