ABC 13 really? Do y'all hate cops or do you report things with headlines like this to continue to stir the cop hating pot?? This man JUMPED, he didn't fall, wasn't pushed... JUMPED! He wanted to end his life. Maybe the officers themselves couldn't swim? And with all the gear on would have likely drowned themselves. A duty rig on average weighs 30+ pounds, boots, uniforms, badges, etc. not only do you not want cops defending their lives, you want them to further risk their lives for somebody who obviously doesn't want to live. The family that thinks deputies should have done more... Ok well what did you do to prevent his suicide? Obviously he had a mental issue or emotional issue or something. Why not quit blaming cops and look at your own relationship with your family member. It's sad for anybody to lose their life, sad when anybody feels that death is better than life. It's tragic for for everybody involved. But how are you gonna say somebody else should have done more? And to the person who was allegedly filming this whole thing go down, obviously capturing deputies allegedly not doing anything, was more important to you or you would have tried.... I really wish the media would quit breeding hate, and negativity for law enforcement. One day, peace officers are gonna get fed up with this police brutality crap, unable to defend their own lives because it will make the news as they were wrong, and racist, and oppressive and quit. Then The looting, and burnings and riots we saw in Baltimore and Ferguson will run rampant across the nation, murder, and rape, and burglaries, and other crime will skyrocket until good people are afraid to go out side. It will be like \"\"\"\"the purge\"\"\"\" but everyday. Nobody will be being saved, no criminals brought to justice... Keep it up ABC 13. Why not report on the BPP protests in Austin where they are calling for the killing of white law enforcement officer? Why not report on our foreign AND domestic terrorism that is a real threat?
