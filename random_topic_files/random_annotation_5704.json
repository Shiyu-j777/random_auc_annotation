Women have, on average, 2.5 children over the course of 50 or so years in the workforce. The number of women that will need to pump during work in the same time period in the same workplace is going to be a pretty low percentage. Plus, most employers already do this out of basic human decency. When I worked in an office and pumped twice a day, I took my laptop with me and continued to work. I took way less break time than the smokers.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0308,"user_ideo":-0.5477,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":10},{"user_id":1247051375328661,"comment_id":10156527515135594,"date":"2016-02-13","message":"Michael Moore you did it!
