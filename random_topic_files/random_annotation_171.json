I'll help you ..... He is a socialist - Sanders is a socialist. Okay, a Democratic Socialist for people with insistent terminology, but when it comes to economic policy there is no functional difference. Socialists believe that the government should control the means of production while democratic socialists believe that government should control the means of production, but still let people vote. This type of political economy destroys most forms of economic growth while at the same time serving to reduce the quality of life and the rights and freedoms of citizens in the country.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9448,"user_ideo":0.3456,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":171},{"user_id":10154145422824902,"comment_id":10154998919451509,"date":"2016-07-05","message":"This is a tragedy, full stop.

But to be quite honest, most people his age are ripe for a heart attack. I don't want a president to die in office. I'd rather have somebody a little younger, like Carson to be up for presidential elections because I trust him to be more for the people than Trump or Sanders. Carson may not want the minimum wage raised, but he definitely wants to come up with a better way to fix everything so that Trump doesn't F it up.
