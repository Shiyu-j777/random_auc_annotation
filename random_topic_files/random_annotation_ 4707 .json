During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said. He added that accusations of incitement and the closure of media offices must not occur without due process. Haim Shibi, a member of the foreign relations committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of ¡°turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually portraying the IDF [Israeli army] as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills them.¡±","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0372,"user_ideo":-0.5781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":9},{"user_id":1069348119787327,"comment_id":10155796805607178,"date":"2017-01-17","message":"I'm sure Hillary owes way more than Trump but they won't say anything about that.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9723,"user_ideo":0.4028,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":10},{"user_id":10208383304531702,"comment_id":10153140967314060,"date":"2015-03-14","message":"^this .... paid idiot alert .... how was the ham sandwich and the R$ 35 ... to write bulshit here","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3162,"user_ideo":-0.4129,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":11},{"user_id":10206224588933036,"comment_id":10153363551294091,"date":"2015-12-06","message":"Old fashion way!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7148,"user_ideo":-0.262,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":12},{"user_id":10158987081000322,"comment_id":10153790654588645,"date":"2016-04-29","message":"I would love to try this with Hank but it does scare me","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3311,"user_ideo":0.0258,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":13},{"user_id":1057638187654318,"comment_id":10153791718739138,"date":"2015-12-19","message":"Awe, I love this â¡","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2378,"user_ideo":-0.1797,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":14},{"user_id":1747803525491556,"comment_id":978456782299102,"date":"2016-12-24","message":"Obama got himself villied on his own.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9574,"user_ideo":0.2989,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":15},{"user_id":10209993809914258,"comment_id":10153665206891990,"date":"2016-08-16","message":"Strict time schedules?
