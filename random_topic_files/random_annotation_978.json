These documents give conclusive proof that America is a Christian nation. One does not need a law degree or a degree in history to grasp this truth. It is obvious to anyone who does not have an agenda. Declaration of Independence: The Declaration has many references to God throughout the document. The most famous one is that men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. “We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness” Here are more references to God found in the document: Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” Appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World” With a firm Reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence” Article 33 of that first Constitution read this way: \"\"\"\"That, as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to him; all persons, professing the Christian religion, are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; \"\"\"\"wherefore no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice.... \"\"\"\"yet the Legislature may, in their discretion, lay a general and equal tax for the support of the Christian religion.\"\"\"\" Article 55 laid down the following requirement for anyone who wanted to serve in public office in the newly established state: \"\"\"\"That every person, appointed to any office... shall... take the following oath: \"\"\"\"I...do swear, that I do not hold myself bound in allegiance to the King of Great Britain, and that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to the State of Maryland; and shall also subscribe a declaration of his belief in the Christian religion.\"\"\"\" In other words, no one but Christians were allowed to hold public office.

They do not make public school uniform wearers wear a sweater at all times. They have short sleeve shirts they can wear. And I never had AC when I was kid at home or school and I always had 30+ kids in my classes. We all made it and turned out just fine. Sure it was hot at times and sure it sucked, but we survived and we even managed to still complete all our work in school and chores at home. Also, temperatures now are no worse than they were then. That is just made up crap people say. While I do think that they should work on getting AC in schools simply just to make it more comfortable and so schools don't have to close when it gets to hot, I also think we are making this generation into a bunch of sissy cry babies who can't handle anything and thinks the whole world should change and revolve around them and what they want. Then when they don't get their way they throw temper tantrums and cause a ruckus. Well it's not a good thing because the real world doesn't work like that. In the real world you have to be tough and have thick skin, be able to endure situations where you may not be the most comfortable and still have to function and do your job, etc.. These kids need to learn this somehow and constantly being pampered isn't teaching them anything.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7634,"user_ideo":0.5508,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":20,"json_serial_number":978}]
