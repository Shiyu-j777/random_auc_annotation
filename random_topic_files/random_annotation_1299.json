The term aid and comfort refers to any act that manifests a betrayal of allegiance to the United States, such as furnishing enemies with Arms, Troops, Transportation, Shelter, or Classified Information. If a subversive act has any tendency to weaken the power of the United States to attack or resist its enemies, aid and comfort has been given.\"\"\"\" Under such Hillary and Obama has committed such with Benghazi, supplying arms to what is now ISIS. Hillary has compromised classified information. The Iran Deal has a subversive act of weakening the power of the United States. The firing of long standing generals who oppose Obama's leadership is weakening the power of the United States. Anyone who supports the Iran deal are also in contempt of this provision in the constitution. The President undermining and allowing illegal aliens in this country, has allowed criminals in this country, including ISIS members with oncoming 'refugees' and open borders...providing aid and comfort to these people. Clinton and Bernie sanders on National Television stated they want to give aid, free housing, free college to these illegal aliens and refugees. Such is all considered treasonous under our constitution for undermining the safety of this country and its citizens.
