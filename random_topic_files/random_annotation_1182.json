No elementary age kid should be left outside at a freezing bus stop. Period. And definitely not left alone to wait for the bus. If the school notified the parents of how long it was going to be, then the parents should have brought the kids back in the house where there was heat. This feeble attempt to shift responsibility to the school is pathetic. If the school notified me that the bus was running that late my kid would come back in. Again, hope to God you don't have children and if you do I beg the question , would you leave your 5 to 9 year old child outside for an hour when its under 10 degrees?
