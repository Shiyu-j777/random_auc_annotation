The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":4},{"user_id":1154728004597162,"comment_id":1053324188097166,"date":"2015-11-16","message":"Or maybe Wall Street realizes that Clinton is the most qualified.

I've been married twice. First time was a mistake because we had nothing in common. Second time was a whirlwind and when it was good it was really good, but I found out way too late when I was most vulnerable that she had no intention of taking any responsibility for our marriage, but she had every intention of taking as much property and money as she could. And yes, I know, don't let my cynicism ruin anyone else's dream...I just think it's a good idea to be smart.
