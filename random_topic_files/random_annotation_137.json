Trump spent months strongly criticizing big donors now he needs their help and many of them are saying \"\"\"\"Sorry you already accused us of being corrupt and the worse part of our political process AND WORDS HAVE CONSEQUENCES\"\"\"\"!!! A recent survey on FB reflected that 90% of all political postings subjects rarely if ever are picked up by any of the regular cable and local news networks! There are 324 million citizens and 210 million registered voters and less than 2% of our voting citizens see any of what is discussed politically on FB or any of the other social networks! Both nominee's to win office need to get a minimum of 75 to 80 million votes to win the Oval Office! The historical participation rate by Registered Voters is 58%! The greatest participation rates since data has been kept were 63% 1960 and 61% 2008! So it is anticipated that the most who will vote in the 2016 General Election will be 130 million and the least 110 million! As of today 51% don't want either candidate and 30% indicate they will vote for the Independent if he gets on State Ballots or most of them will stay home! Hillary has a 55% Unfavorable and Trump just hit a high no one in history has ever achieved a 70% And although Trump broke all records for Votes in the Republican Primary as of today Total Republican/Independent Primary Votes = 25,785,537 (Trump received 14,732,381) Total Democratic/Independent Primary Votes = 28,892,395 in total this represents less than 27% of Registered! Historically, 58% of Registered Voters go to the poles! There were 12 Caucus States where no votes were counted only delegates! In the General Election all those voters who were denied participation in those states get to go straight to their poles or mail their ballots in!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9439,"user_ideo":0.0753,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":137},{"user_id":692224654250088,"comment_id":1818349241729119,"date":"2016-07-28","message":"GO JOE GO TELL THEM.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7865,"user_ideo":-0.4986,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":137},{"user_id":10154348482540102,"comment_id":10155327992916509,"date":"2016-09-19","message":"Shame on Jake Tapper for editing out Hillary Clinton calling them \"\"\"\"bombings\"\"\"\" while he criticized Trump for doing so.
