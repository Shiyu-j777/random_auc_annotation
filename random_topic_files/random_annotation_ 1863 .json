Thus it is easier for those at the top to have greater control over all of us . Someday soon I believe we will come see the reality of this. United we stand divided we fall. This way how can the masses work together when Uncle Sam becomes totalitarian : a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state. Sounds like what DC wants to do to us pawns.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9845,"user_ideo":0.6405,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":2},{"user_id":10155162443125550,"comment_id":1088004121219943,"date":"2016-03-05","message":"Cal vino must be North Korean...

I believe criminal charges are in order. We do have a class action suit already filed and this will guarantee us that we win that! If you have not seen the emails there are thousands of them showing collusion with the media to promote Hillary and even plans to protect themselves from 'looking like' they were committing election fraud ie the actual primary elections and there are many lawsuits filed re the election fraud and voter suppression around the country in favor of Hillary Clinton. The American People Should Be PISSED OFF And DEMAND JUSTICE! Hilary will NEVER Become President and if the DNC has ANY sense, which obviously they don't have much... they will NOT nominate Hillary Clinton and instead Nominate Bernie Sanders who would have won without the election fraud and voter suppression and clearly would have done EVEN BETTER if the DNC has not committed Fraud against Him/US! #NeverHillary #NeverTrump If you don't nominate Bernie WE ARE GOING GREEN! Most people are planning to leave the party after this convention.... I do hope criminal charges are filed. DNC is considered a 'private company' and as such holding a national contest and then rigging it for one particular winner is illegal....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":-0.3512,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":4},{"user_id":10209106429195309,"comment_id":10152930789946336,"date":"2015-01-29","message":"I may have don it I can't remember....","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5713,"user_ideo":0.8657,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":5},{"user_id":658703567616647,"comment_id":10153677123571077,"date":"2016-02-03","message":"Still hot!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3432,"user_ideo":-0.6139,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":6},{"user_id":1617594875205511,"comment_id":10153049802052217,"date":"2015-08-26","message":"He was making a movie before dying.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2502,"user_ideo":-0.1046,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":7},{"user_id":10210561298732514,"comment_id":10154240669308279,"date":"2016-06-23","message":"Obama has little influence over the practice.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1567,"user_ideo":-0.6066,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":8},{"user_id":10208814204506490,"comment_id":1173008089458910,"date":"2016-06-30","message":"Protesting a presidential candidate isn't illegal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0209,"user_ideo":-0.8658,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":9},{"user_id":10209995417143915,"comment_id":1009172665761657,"date":"2015-05-03","message":"Another good reason for his retirement this year.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.589,"user_ideo":0.6811,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":10},{"user_id":1387192367963188,"comment_id":10152652260211545,"date":"2015-01-14","message":"Me too!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3067,"user_ideo":0.1979,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":11},{"user_id":10155113224008709,"comment_id":10155108785255530,"date":"2017-02-21","message":"Draymond Green went to Michigan State","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2654,"user_ideo":-0.0087,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":12},{"user_id":1341315749231685,"comment_id":10154182603739641,"date":"2016-06-02","message":"Ties to aliens?
