The Jewish people have their holidays, and are able to take them off as legal holidays. In fact, when my kids were in school, their \"\"\"\"holiday\"\"\"\" play included Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and their REAL meanings, yet left out the true meaning of Christmas. They only correlated Christmas with Santa and Rudolph. You can go to the store and find things for those religions. But, this has been a primarily Judeau-Christian nation. The courts were decorated with The Ten Commandments and our dollars embellished with In God We Trust. What I do see is an all-out assault on Christianity and anything correlating to Christmas as a Christian holiday. Sad that there are people so offended by the birth of Jesus, the savior, but it was foretold that this would happen. Oh, and for the record, I wouldn't file a complaint if a teacher had a Kwanzaa decoration displayed or if Hindu had one displayed. It doesn't offend me that they choose to practice or celebrate their religion and holidays. My celebration shouldn't offend them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9801,"user_ideo":0.5228,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":2},{"user_id":10208398689148175,"comment_id":10153900997614203,"date":"2015-12-17","message":"Soylent Green seems like a viable solution at this point lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1195,"user_ideo":-0.2908,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":3},{"user_id":1094633757242590,"comment_id":10155215789738690,"date":"2017-02-14","message":"These whales refloating after stranding is a start, at least.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0332,"user_ideo":-0.6544,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":4},{"user_id":10208117481828068,"comment_id":10154197871677169,"date":"2016-11-26","message":"Awesome!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4298,"user_ideo":-0.7088,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":5},{"user_id":600475816829538,"comment_id":1039749539456985,"date":"2016-09-02","message":"But I thought every hacker reported directly to the president of their country...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2055,"user_ideo":-0.0193,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":6},{"user_id":10206175624741138,"comment_id":10153122936611037,"date":"2015-02-20","message":"I would have done the same thing. I had an amnio in 1989. If something had been wrong, I would have terminated the pregnancy. I did not want my older 2 kids to have to perhaps eventually have to take care of a child with disabilities because Mom decided to wear a \"\"\"\"badge of honor\"\"\"\". Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so. That decision to have your child is yours, just like it was her decision to terminate. Her decision did not affect you in any way, so why make it personal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0696,"user_ideo":0.6275,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":7},{"user_id":10206759490385464,"comment_id":10154745797866162,"date":"2016-10-06","message":"Finally.
