I encourage you all to learn about our history concerning #StandingRock, #NorthDakota and the #Lakota. You see this behavior by the United States government isn't anything new. It's not the first time our government has wanted natural resources that lay beneath native ground and on their land. In 1890 the US government massacred Sitting Bull and HUNDREDS of his people for access to mine gold. This isn't the first time they have incited violence on peaceful people to succeed in gaining land rights. There is nothing that is ok with the actions taken these past months by the private security forces hired, local and state police and our national guard. The global community needs to step in...or WE need to step in. History is repeating itself right under us. We know how it ends.
