But with that said, everything they said made it look like it was the Patriots that were firing with rifles, when all the shooting was the FBI snipers and cops. It is heartbreaking how low our country has become. How people are not rallying around this to stop the injustices. As to the other folks, sharpton etc of course they will not be there. #1. Those folks are white. #2. They are Obama henchmen and this is an order from Obama to create this situation. He needs the conflict/civil unrest to declare Marshall law. The race baiting is not working because we, the whites, used words not force to fight back.

Every single opportunity that a preacher gets to make himself rich off of your tythes, he will take it, and there is nothing that the law will do about it. That opportunity to get rich off of an invisible product is one of the main reasons that religion was invented in the first place. And why do you think that you know Christianity better than anyone else? You are going off of the same book that Benny Hinn goes off of, and other millionaire preachers use to justify skimming. Don't be so sure that you have found the right way.
