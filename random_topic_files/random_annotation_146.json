If you limit someone else's speech in potentia you make a rod for your own back. I would however say calling for murder is probably the fine line even I would draw. But you must draw that line very solidly and not extend it. I find Geert Wilders despicable but have yet to see anything that I wouldn't defend his right to say...because that also defends my right to tear his view down. The ONLY way good ideas can win, and they must win, is if we solidly defend free speech for all. Because if we don't people get lazy, they hide behind the law, they forget their facts and then the only ones who know the facts are those speaking the most despicable filth...and that gives them power and prevents us defeating their views.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0075,"user_ideo":-0.4446,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":146},{"user_id":226927237704752,"comment_id":10155260224844411,"date":"2017-02-25","message":"How many did we kill?
