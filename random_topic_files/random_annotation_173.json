She had a car accident on the way to school with her brother and a friend in the back seat. A guy in a truck was late for work and was speeding in a 25 mile an hour zone and broadsided them and totaled the car. All three children were sent to the hospital with minor injuries. The school took away her perfect attendance and she only missed the one day. She was left with pretty bad bruises and the little girl in the back had to have stitches in her head. But considering it was a Ford Festiva they were really lucky. The guy with the truck tried to sue. I told him bring it on. Teenagers in my town are told they are always at fault because teenagers have bad judgment. I told him come on I'll take him on. He dropped it. His insurance told him he could not win this one.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4608,"user_ideo":0.6677,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":160,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":173},{"user_id":10206631170953638,"comment_id":10155236533548984,"date":"2017-02-24","message":"Thanks for stepping out and giving your input!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2751,"user_ideo":0.4866,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":173},{"user_id":1334823326545871,"comment_id":10153906998911002,"date":"2015-04-17","message":"Grab a straw!
