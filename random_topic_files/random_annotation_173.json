I am all about traditional roles, however, these women PERFORMED ALL that was required physically and emotionally. Every service man I spoke to said they would be proud to serve with them.

She went through a squealing stage, but we broke her of it. Our grandchildren are fun loving and rambunctious like all kids, but when we all sit at dinner at night we teach manners, inside voices, etc. Children can be taught \"\"\"\"no\"\"\"\" at a very early age. Many people think kids are just little , but the formative years are 0-5, and much of the personalities are shaped and formed in the first five years. When our children were little I would take them to meetings at church for example, and they would sit quietly and play with their books and toys. We were often complimented. We were not perfect parents, but we worked hard at training our children to be respectful, thoughtful, and kind. Those things have to be taught. You make children aware of other people's feelings. Yes, I am quite aware of what a ten month old is capable of. My entire life has been devoted to children ... My own and through the school system, so I know what I am talking about. Bottom line...
