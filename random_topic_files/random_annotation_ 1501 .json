Is there somehow who actually disagrees with that? Everyone crying tears into a pillow that their PS4v1 might no longer be the top dog of consoles should get a grip. Technology is obsolete before it even hits retailers. How do these sorts of stories yield so many nonsensical replies? The heat comments are garbage, betraying a fundamental misunderstanding of the entire field. GPUs get better. Indeed, one of the biggest improvements lately has been *huge* reductions in the power consumption, and thus heat, of GPUs.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0083,"user_ideo":-0.3106,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":3},{"user_id":10208796585225734,"comment_id":1361851457168540,"date":"2017-01-15","message":"One could argue Trump is ensuring immigrants stay in the USA!

The Jewish people have their holidays, and are able to take them off as legal holidays. In fact, when my kids were in school, their \"\"\"\"holiday\"\"\"\" play included Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and their REAL meanings, yet left out the true meaning of Christmas. They only correlated Christmas with Santa and Rudolph. You can go to the store and find things for those religions. But, this has been a primarily Judeau-Christian nation. The courts were decorated with The Ten Commandments and our dollars embellished with In God We Trust. What I do see is an all-out assault on Christianity and anything correlating to Christmas as a Christian holiday. Sad that there are people so offended by the birth of Jesus, the savior, but it was foretold that this would happen. Oh, and for the record, I wouldn't file a complaint if a teacher had a Kwanzaa decoration displayed or if Hindu had one displayed. It doesn't offend me that they choose to practice or celebrate their religion and holidays. My celebration shouldn't offend them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9801,"user_ideo":0.5228,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":9},{"user_id":10155101668287150,"comment_id":10153745045886323,"date":"2015-11-11","message":"#Thecove is equally important with regards to saving these creatures.
