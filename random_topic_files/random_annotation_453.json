Well, give me one reason why Americans should trust Republicans. They haven't shown the best judgement when choosing our leaders. George W. Bush ignored repeated warnings from the CIA that our country was going to be attacked and took a five-week vacation before we experienced the worst terrorist attack in our nation's history. Then he lied us into Iraq and sent close to 4500 brave American soldiers to their deaths. Republicans responded by flocking to the polls to re-elect him. So again, please tell me why Americans should trust Republicans?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"user_ideo":-0.6146,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":453},{"user_id":1061303233945513,"comment_id":1198329623520399,"date":"2015-09-15","message":"Ryan Pugmire us one day!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.022,"user_ideo":-0.4312,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":453},{"user_id":1668479650138683,"comment_id":10153656329741336,"date":"2015-09-07","message":"Support to these officers and their decals.
