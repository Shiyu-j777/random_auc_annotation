Be proud of every one of them. You fought the fierce battle and came out a winner! Our seven year old great granddaughter went through open heart surgery and shows off her scar. God is watching over you, Carter, and even though those scars are visible, you have such beauty on the inside. Those scars will fade in time, not all the way, but everytime you see them in the mirror, just remember that when God brings you to it, He will bring you through it. Good luck, young man, our prayers go out to you. There will be so many kids asking to see them, and admire you for what you have been through.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9459,"user_ideo":0.6761,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":4},{"user_id":10209065093456479,"comment_id":10154660880394411,"date":"2016-09-07","message":"It's Israel not Fuck U Putin who's doing the hacking....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0674,"user_ideo":-0.4968,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":5},{"user_id":1267251386639974,"comment_id":10153660164363721,"date":"2016-04-23","message":"keep runnin","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6974,"user_ideo":-0.5136,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":6},{"user_id":10201965358652666,"comment_id":10153132261278984,"date":"2015-02-13","message":"HE WONT BECAUSE HE'S WITH THEM!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9807,"user_ideo":0.8479,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":7},{"user_id":10208223403854605,"comment_id":723564164431925,"date":"2015-02-24","message":"President bashing has made America a joke.
