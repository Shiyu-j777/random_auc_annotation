Sounds like you had issues absorbing iron and possibly you weren't taking B12 supplements. As as for B12, it's not just vegans having issues with B12, farm animals are having to be injected with it because they are no longer getting enough either as farming methods have depleted the supply of it from our soil.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0093,"user_ideo":-0.5164,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":1},{"user_id":1759442854314156,"comment_id":10153165187902300,"date":"2015-03-16","message":"And they're going to do WHAT exactly to us?

Anytime you start paying people out of tax money collected from the public you end up with roo few dollars to spend on gvt.housing, medical Drs and supplies and food programs.

And that's all I was really trying to ask. You and I both watched Clinton and Trump speeches without media bias and simply came to different conclusions. You and I both, as well as plenty of other Americans, put in the research to lead us to choose who we voted for as president. I was hoping for more actually related to his business and Trump News than Clinton coming up again. Trump is the president elect so I was wondering about him. Maybe you assume I'm tugging at some strings or something, but I was just looking for more on the business aspect.
