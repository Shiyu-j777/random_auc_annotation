So how nice of you to grace us with your uneducated answer. God is light and is only good the devil is darkness and causes disasters and bad things to happen. If God fixed everything all the time how would there ever be a good and an evil? How when miracles happen could we say it was God. I'm a grateful believer in Jesus Christ but I am also not stupid. This had nothing to do with God or the devil it had everything to do with three lunatics who used arson to burn down a wooded area that is surrounded by homes and businesses. God didn't make that choice for them. He can only send the angels to protect and watch over with his love and grace.....I know this was a horrible disaster but it could have been much much worse more people could have died the state could be covered in fire no just two little towns. These criminals set this spot on fire bc they knew it would get the attention of others it's a heavy populated area and they were obviously mad at someone or something to want to cause so much distraction. In fact they might even have been mad at God and the only reason someone would be mad at God is bc they don't know him and don't care to. I feel bad for them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9023,"user_ideo":0.2666,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":921},{"user_id":10153682490102623,"comment_id":10153095249867093,"date":"2015-09-26","message":"This kid should take a trip to the White House, not a kid playing a bomb hoax.
