I do tend to look at people oddly when they drink cow's milk because I think it's disgusting. For those who don't look at others oddly when they drink cow's milk, their reasonings are likely because when we drink cow's milk, it's usually out of a cup, which comes from a carton/jug/bag. We don't generally see grown humans hanging off of a cow's udder when they want a drink. That would be weird.. and we would look at them oddly.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0205,"user_ideo":-0.5775,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":2},{"user_id":10209799738491513,"comment_id":10153945101896336,"date":"2015-12-30","message":"he identifies as a traffic signal, it's legit in california","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6098,"user_ideo":0.8948,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":3},{"user_id":10206869766765582,"comment_id":1028529540520851,"date":"2015-05-04","message":"How much did all the GM bond holders get back?
