I had an amnio in 1989. If something had been wrong, I would have terminated the pregnancy. I did not want my older 2 kids to have to perhaps eventually have to take care of a child with disabilities because Mom decided to wear a \"\"\"\"badge of honor\"\"\"\". Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so. That decision to have your child is yours, just like it was her decision to terminate. Her decision did not affect you in any way, so why make it personal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0696,"user_ideo":0.6275,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":4},{"user_id":10210848736478193,"comment_id":1300295063323854,"date":"2016-02-07","message":"What's the violent part of the race?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4757,"user_ideo":-0.6805,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":5},{"user_id":10210086329698660,"comment_id":10154398680637144,"date":"2017-01-11","message":"MY GOD YES!...sorry, the only voice I have is sarcastic...or worse...this man (sic) is a plague on the world...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2214,"user_ideo":-0.635,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":6},{"user_id":1233549586696355,"comment_id":1147710071944205,"date":"2016-10-20","message":"Sarah Ward I feel sorry for you dear, you are lost in stress hormones, and missing the point entirely, esp with a hormone like cortisol, which is elevated in ATHLETES and those who are more ACTIVE, such as a NATURAL animal in its NATURAL environment, the open sea...swimming THOUSANDS of more miles per month, than an ENSLAVED being, being kept in a TINY tank, with barely enough room to swim enough to release an endorphine, let alone a hormone that is NORMALLY elevated by a NATURAL LIFE, in a NATURAL ENVIRONMENT....ya know genius, my stress hormones would go down if I was kept in a tiny tank and had nothing to worry about and nowhere to go, however, I would not call what I was doing LIVING....again, you are attempting to defend the indefensible, warping the use of biochemistry to fit your PORPOISES....when you are ready to have lower cortisol levels via the extreme adrenal exhaustion put upon you from being held a captive prisoner and tortured every day, let me know....I know some guys in the plexiglass business","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0405,"user_ideo":-0.3326,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":7},{"user_id":1876839599210407,"comment_id":959968514024492,"date":"2015-04-22","message":"This may stop the Chinese from copying.
