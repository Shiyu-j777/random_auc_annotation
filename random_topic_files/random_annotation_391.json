Steve Harvey did not have to stay and apologize, but he did and he owned up to his error. He quickly acted on the error and made what was wrong to a right. Steve Harvey corrected it before he was even told by the production company during the show last night. Interesting, I just watched this yesterday, prior to the pageant, on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday with Brené Brown talking about what is trust, and accountability was one of the traits. How can you trust someone if that person cannot be accountable for his or her own actions? The producers of the pageant immediately forgave Steve Harvey for what he did because on his own he corrected the wrong and took accountability for his human era, therefore this production company will support him through this matter. And most likely Steve Harvey will continue to work with the organization in the future. Now that's all over, let's get back to our regularly schedule program.

Elias of Perkins Coie LLP. Elias is implicated on many emails as having given advice to â€œHRCâ€ (Hillary Rodham Clinton) directly. Including this email where the main topic of conversation is FEC enforcement: On May 7, 2015, at 4:21 PM, Robby Mook re47@hillaryclinton.com wrote: Let's get a call set up with us and HRC next wk to discuss: FEC enforcement options Here Elias is advising HRC on soft money from SuperPACs, specifically Priorities USA (in the attachment): And here we have HRC and her surrogates being told directly do not coordinate with SuperPACs within 120 days of candidacy: Accordingly, we have recommended that Secretary Clinton and her agents not coordinate on message with Priorities USA during the â€œtesting the watersâ€ phase. Here is Robby Mook and Elias suggesting that ex-Mayor of NYC Bloomberg would help via Priorites and that the HRC campaign would script his answers for him, presumably through â€œHoward.â€ If that is happening, we should script out. - Elias Defer to others. I think priorities should call Howard but that's about all I have. - Mook And here we have Robby Mook suggesting that HRC has such power over the board of directors that they can convince Frmr. Gov. Granholm to step down, just days before the announcement: More on Gov. Granholm, as the campaign directly schedules an ex- Correct the Record member named Schriok and Gov. Granholm, who will work at CTR for an unknown period of time prior to becoming an â€œunpaidâ€ surrogate. The implication is that her time at CTR would pay well enough to cover her time off of CTR. Aaaaaaand here is Gov. Granholm suggesting she be paid for her surrogacy the same salary she is paid at UC Berkley: And as for Hillary? Well, in July of 2015, well after her candidacy was announced, she gets status updates on Priorities via meetings with Elias, Huma, and Mook: And here they are denying the meetings ever happened after the NYT tried to break this story: There was a methodical plan from the beginning to coordinate with PACs either by skirting the law, or outright breaking it. There is conspiracy to commit acts that are technically illegal, at best. At worst, Hillaryâ€s campaign is directly using PAC money, specifically Priorities USA and Correct the Record, to pay surrogates to say kind words about her. And they knew it was all wrong, because they denied all of it, and used a lawyer for attorney-client privileges. Oh, and one more thing, here's an email from Hillary herself regarding the dark money, and her top aides discussing how they need to do the same to avoid getting run over: Adding Elias. I agree with you, John. I think we focus hard on raising as much as we can and then throw the kitchen sink at everyone who we believe steps over the line, understanding that has limited impact. Why is this a terrible sentence coming from Mook? Well, for one, they mention working with Priorities again (even though she's announcing very soon), and also that dern bundler network: Campaigns also get nervous as the bundler networks expand ever outward. Pretty soon, money is coming in from raisers and writers that the campaign might not really know. It's a breeding ground for scandal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.364,"user_ideo":-0.3229,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":20,"json_serial_number":391}]
