Elephants are protected, though they do allow a limited harvest because they are eating themselves out of house and home in some areas. There must be a balance between population numbers and food sources. Each elephant needs hundreds of pounds of foliage a day to be healthy. If they don't harvest some, they will starve to death because they are eating all the food sources in some areas. I have seen photos of some areas stripped bare because of poor regulation and the elephants are starving. Starving is one of the worst ways to die. It is a slow and lingering painful death. Airlines in those countries are strictly regulated by the government in what they bring in or out of the country. If they want to do business there, they follow the rules. The airlines don't dictate policy to the governments of those countries. It is the government who decides what animals are endangered and what the airlines will do. If the airlines don't, then the government brings in other airlines to do business. The countries of Africa have for years enacted extremely strict rules to regulate any hunting and protect their animals. Many animals are forbidden to hunt. Some can be hunted in some areas because there is an over abundance, but are forbidden to hunt in other areas in an effort to increase their numbers. This is not the Africa of a hundred years ago. Just as we can't judge those people of a hundred years ago by our standards, they were doing the best they could with their available knowledge, let us not judge the people of today with our incomplete knowledge or by drivel the hero makers of today's P.R. firms spew out to gain the sympathies and hearts of good people who don't understand the necessary role of a regulated harvest of animals that aren't able to regulate themselves! Where regulated hunting exists, the animals grow stronger and more abundant, not less. It also brings in much needed funds to very poor countries which go to medicine, schools, and other much needed supplies. The people also prosper in those areas through an expanded tourism program. If you do your shooting through photos, that is good! I was a photographer for years and it is an extremely satisfying hobby (profession). However, let us be careful in taking something away from others we do not agree with. In time it may be us that is losing something we enjoy because others do not agree with us. It is a dicey thing to try and improve society by taking something away from others and not improve it by adding something to it from our own actions.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4993,"user_ideo":0.8918,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":312},{"user_id":1195054677183045,"comment_id":10155106509484445,"date":"2017-02-12","message":"Get the illegal immigrants shovels and let them do some good for our kids.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9042,"user_ideo":0.259,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":312},{"user_id":10210184426269932,"comment_id":10153395820392061,"date":"2016-02-11","message":"Unlike, unfollow.
