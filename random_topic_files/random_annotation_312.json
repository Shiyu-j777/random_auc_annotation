Get yourself a wedding photographer (not just any photographer, an actual wedding photographer!). It is after all, a once (or twice, or thrice for some?) in a lifetime event that you want to have amazing pictures of and while yes your family and friends will take photos and all, do you seriously want to leave it to chance? It is hard work, it takes skill, it takes education and practice.

I went years with a sleep disorder and eventually went to a neurologist because I thought was having signs of dementia or something because my memory was horrible. After testing and MRI to rule out other possibilities she suggested I get my stress and sleep problems under control.After trying several things that had bad side effects and left me feeling like a zombie someone suggested essential oils. Bingo! It didn't happen overnight but over the next couple months of trying different combinations my sleep cycle corrected itself. It had made a world of difference in my mind functioning. I don't think people realize how much long term sleep issues can impact your brain.
