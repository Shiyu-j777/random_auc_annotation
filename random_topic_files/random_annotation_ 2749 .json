Is it possible for humans to establish a government that will really bring lasting peace and happiness? What does the record of human history show? Ecclesiastes 8:9 tells us, \"\"\"\"Man has dominated man to his injury.\"\"\"\" (This is true even though some governments and rulers have stayed off with high ideals.) Every civilization that has ever existed has ultimately collapsed. History is a tale of efforts that failed, or aspirations that weren't realized. What hinders human efforts in the field of government? Jeremiah 10:23 says, \"\"\"\"I well know, O Jehovah, that to earthling man his way does not belong. It does not belong to man who is walking even to direct his step.\"\"\"\" Genesis 8:21 \"\"\"\"The inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up.\"\"\"\" Will putting other men in office solve the problem? Is it not true that where there are free elections the men in power are usually voted out of office in a relatively few years? Why? A majority are not satisfied with their performance. Psalms 146:4,3 has this to say: \"\"\"\"Do not put your trust in nobles, nor in the son of earthling man, to whom no salvation belongs. (So, any programs for betterment that rulers institute soon pass into the hands of others and are frequently abandoned.) Even if corrupt rulers are ousted and unjust laws discarded, the new government will be made up of imperfect humans and will be part of the political system that the Bible clearly says is under the control of Satan. Human rulers are not providing what mankind urgently needs. Consider these things that people everywhere need, that human governments are not providing but that God has promised: (1) Life in a world free from the threat of wars. Isaiah 2:4 \"\"\"\"And he will certainly render judgement among the nation's and set matters straight respecting many peoples. And they will have to beat their swords into plowshears and their spears into pruning shears. Nation will not lift up swords against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.\"\"\"\" Government by God is the only solution to the problems of mankind. The problems that need to be resolved require power, abilities, and qualities that no human possess. Reading and studying God's word the Bible, will help all to come to know our grand creator Jehovah God. 2 Timothy 3:16 \"\"\"\"All scripture is inspired of God and beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight, for disciplining in righteousness, that the man of God may be fully competent, completely equipped for every good work.\"\"\"\" Psalms 83:18 \"\"\"\" That people may know that you, who's name is Jehovah, you alone is the most hight over all the earth.\"\"\"\" **Read your bible daily.**","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.982,"user_ideo":0.3089,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":3},{"user_id":10208370747839642,"comment_id":10154835710499255,"date":"2016-11-11","message":"That we as tax payers foot.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4982,"user_ideo":-0.6468,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":4},{"user_id":10153666426585718,"comment_id":1277924248898260,"date":"2016-07-18","message":"Is there any way we can help these poor people?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2144,"user_ideo":0.6693,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":5},{"user_id":10210204846146001,"comment_id":10155415712900389,"date":"2015-03-22","message":"Looks like some fine folks from Gruberville stopped by...how nice.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.957,"user_ideo":0.6034,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":6},{"user_id":10201959867234851,"comment_id":10154901902119609,"date":"2017-01-09","message":"That sucks!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5661,"user_ideo":0.415,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":7},{"user_id":913259265475285,"comment_id":10154653710749614,"date":"2016-09-19","message":"This is how terminator starts","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.316,"user_ideo":0.281,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":8},{"user_id":10206607479686449,"comment_id":10153185570135950,"date":"2015-10-20","message":"Calm down!
