This student locked her legs to her desk , made it difficult to grab her. This girl obviously has no respect for her teacher or the officer. This school resource officer goes to work to protect his students. His job is on the line all because some girl could not follow a simple direction. To leave the classroom. When i was growing up you had respect for your elders especially at school. Your there to learn and get a education. This student has a major attitude and thinks she can do whatever she wants. More than likely the girl gets her attitude from her parents or parent. Of course this will turn into a race issue just like 's parents are still making excuses for Michael. Students have rules they must follow. It's not rocket science. I would not be suprised if the girls parents file a lawsuit and they will turn this into a circus. Instead of the parent's admitting their daughter was at fault. You can see from few different videos that the officer was doing his job. Just prior to this innocent. The officer received an award for doing a good job. The school should be ashamed of themselves. Only reason I can see why they released him from his duties was a race issue and didn't want to have a race war. That is so wrong on so many levels. That is teaching that black people are above everyone else. I rather see this girl go to jail for assaulting the officer.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9617,"user_ideo":0.3869,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":521},{"user_id":1074666375959717,"comment_id":10153322742854342,"date":"2015-08-29","message":"I would actually pay to see this fight.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2295,"user_ideo":-0.0746,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":521},{"user_id":1199696363404887,"comment_id":10153032712088837,"date":"2015-08-07","message":"Prayers , miracles do happen !","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9376,"user_ideo":-0.251,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":206,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":521},{"user_id":620265144790746,"comment_id":10153497350761770,"date":"2016-05-10","message":"If you are confused on what bathroom to go in just look in your underwear!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9931,"user_ideo":0.4558,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":521},{"user_id":1090339421060810,"comment_id":10153399848421336,"date":"2015-06-27","message":"Precious...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7478,"user_ideo":0.5704,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":521},{"user_id":10207718309449835,"comment_id":10150822725794999,"date":"2016-06-07","message":"Liam, again, if you had bothered to read the article, you would have noted that the documentary was made several years ago and is only just being released. They aren't seeking attention, nor are they \"\"\"\"encouraging harmful behavior in their child.\"\"\"\" Far from it--they are bravely accepting her for who she is. The article is about the release of the documentary and the story Coy's family was bold and gracious enough to share at the time. They made the documentary to help and encourage other families and children like Coy, and since then they have deliberately stepped back from the public eye. They declined to be interviewed for the article and are living out of the spotlight in order to pursue a normal life for their family. If they were 'seeking attention,' they wouldn't have declined an interview.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0069,"user_ideo":-0.6883,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":521},{"user_id":1626860204291176,"comment_id":10153247284559087,"date":"2015-10-03","message":"Why are they not giving out all the info?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5982,"user_ideo":0.1482,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":521},{"user_id":544286512422083,"comment_id":10154254180869609,"date":"2016-06-14","message":"R I P Mrs. Brenda Lee Marquez McCool , My deepest Condolences to her children's and family.
