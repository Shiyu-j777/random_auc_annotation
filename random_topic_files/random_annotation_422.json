There are people who are happy, functional intelligent adults in many professions and walks of life who while they have a penis do not have a scrotum and have taken hormones to where the penis is irrelevant and possibly temporary. These individuals have breasts and feminine facial features and live as and simply are women. Despite what they were born as. This is the world we live in today. These people are beloved family and friends of other people just like the rest of us. Passing a law which requires one of these adult individuals to use the mens room is crazy. Where children are concerned the subject gets trickier for me. I respect the rights of the transgendered kids, but I also respect the rights all kids to be kids and different levels of maturity need to be taken into consideration, so situations of trans kids in schools should be dealt with in each community based on how the kids all feel.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1028,"user_ideo":-0.6674,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":422},{"user_id":10202088683536236,"comment_id":493492377508009,"date":"2015-02-23","message":"Mind your & mine own business.
