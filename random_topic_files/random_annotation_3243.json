By law you must have insurance and registration on your car. But phone Apps, not a chance. Wait till the databases of collected mobile phone numbers get compiled from hacking to spam you with this crap - and then threaten you with it. The virus threat is huge and of course the ultimate - RansomWare, threaten you with bad reviews unless you pay up. This folks, is just the beginning of the end of smart phone freedom. And then the far right will really want to monitor your smart phone. Afterall, if Yelp can track you, why can't the gvt? Many Regulations and legal monitoring of phones is only when it suits extreme views (left or right). And this isn't going to be just an American problem, but global.Organized crime gangs and hackers will have a field day. Those spam txt messages you receive (cuz you probably posted your mobile number on Facebook) is already in the millions of txt per day. With Yelp, it will jump to 100 million per day. And wait until the company gets hacked. Game over.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0053,"user_ideo":-0.23,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":2},{"user_id":1134500706617374,"comment_id":10154141508168128,"date":"2016-03-22","message":"I thought this was a story about Cuba.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3333,"user_ideo":-0.2102,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":3},{"user_id":10208390031802404,"comment_id":1213957242026965,"date":"2016-12-23","message":"I feel sorry for all the unemployed voters that believe he is going to get them jobs. the only people that are going to benefit are Trump and his cronies.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0162,"user_ideo":-0.8202,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":4},{"user_id":261143860972922,"comment_id":1521378207876637,"date":"2016-12-22","message":"Thank you Santa for brightening little ones lives.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7827,"user_ideo":0.8297,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":5},{"user_id":1049640255157439,"comment_id":10154309493138822,"date":"2016-12-03","message":"Put the old golf course back.
