I was working at MN Rubber Co. in St. Louis Park MN in 2000. It is part of the Quadion Corp. The machines were moved to its new factory in Mexico. The St. Louis plant was the most profitable plant in the company. The Mexico plant struggled to make good parts. It was bleeding money. Yet the St. Louis Park MN plant was the one closed. The owner was the son of the company founder. The St. Louise Park MN plant was the birth place of the company. It was torn down and the land sold and upscale condos now sit there.
