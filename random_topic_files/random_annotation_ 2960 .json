Maybe you need to read what you just said to me! They are saying he killed himself and on top of it painted him as a hero,now they are saying he is all these bad things or was,cops can be dirty you you feel me? They do illegal stuff all the time and if him and others on the force we're dealing in criminal activity and look by this picture he looks like a thug,never judge a person by the looks or what the media puts out,maybe he knew to much,is what I am saying maybe he was actually murdered. And what does me owning a gun have to do with me wondering if it were foul play? Is your family member on this police force or are you looking for a argument or a race comment? If not go back to school and learn what words mean because darling you just misinterpreted what I said all the down the line. I do not support criminals and I do not support cops being brutal and I sure as hell do not support people trying to make good cops look bad,and I do not support arguing over bs and arguing over something someone read all wrong.
