I don't play games to 'see myself represented in the media' I play games because they're fun. I'm not a black guy from the hood but GTA San An was still a great game.

I'm not a magical elf wizard but Skyrim was still worth 300 hours. You don't play a game watching a character, you are the character. You are automatically represented simply by playing.
