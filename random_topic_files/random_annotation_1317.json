(same source as above) - In 2015, 12 percent of white and Hispanic homicide deaths were due to police officers, while only four percent of black homicide deaths were the result of police officers. (WallStreet Journal) - In 2015, black cops were 3.3 times more likely to fire a gun than other cops at a crime scene when the victims were of any race. (Department of Justice, FBI data) - 49 percent of those killed by officers from May 2013 to April 2015 were white, while 30 percent were black. 19 percent were Hispanic and 2 percent were Asian and other races. (Washington Times) - A police officer is 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black person than a cop killing an unarmed black person. (WallStreet Journal) - There have been over twice as many cops victimized by fatal shootings in the first three months of 2016 vs. 2015. (same source as above) This is NOT to say that there is not racism in America, nor that the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile were justified, but please know the full statistics before you state \"\"\"\"black lives matter\"\"\"\". The sooner we can get past \"\"\"\"blacks\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"whites\"\"\"\" and get back to \"\"\"\"Americans\"\"\"\" the better off we will all be and the sooner it will allow us ALL to crush any racial inequality that still stands. #AmericaDivided needs to become #AmericaUnited. #Dallas #alllivesmatter EDIT: Anyone is more than welcome to copy and paste this.
