Anyone who studies this guy knows that this was his plan years ago and he even talked about how to dominate the media. So he is constantly in the news and the other candidates are forced to talk about him a lot...so it sucks the air out of their ability to get a reasonable share of airtime....and when they do get it often they are on the defense. It is absolutely brilliant strategy...his actual reality TV experience preped him nicely for this.

Women have, on average, 2.5 children over the course of 50 or so years in the workforce. The number of women that will need to pump during work in the same time period in the same workplace is going to be a pretty low percentage. Plus, most employers already do this out of basic human decency. When I worked in an office and pumped twice a day, I took my laptop with me and continued to work.
