We spend more on military then the next eleven highest spending nations spend combined. For all that, we should be pissed and screaming, not cowering in fear. A laughably transparent conman demagogue like Trump calls the military a 'disaster', and all the suckers just swallow it right up. But I support Trump on one thing, it is time for Germany, France, England, and Japan to pay their fare share of national defense.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0106,"user_ideo":-0.6105,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":1},{"user_id":1032392816857009,"comment_id":10154201225333690,"date":"2016-04-01","message":"Yes.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7805,"user_ideo":-0.3224,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":2},{"user_id":653369601495197,"comment_id":10152725561849094,"date":"2015-01-25","message":"My thoughts and prayers are with the family & friends of this woman today.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4287,"user_ideo":-0.0075,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":3},{"user_id":659597100873546,"comment_id":10153363806003984,"date":"2015-05-06","message":"Good job","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.879,"user_ideo":0.813,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":4},{"user_id":1274659009246203,"comment_id":10153666110137623,"date":"2016-08-08","message":"This is a bunch of ignorant humans being selfish it is wrong to breast feed in public morally.
