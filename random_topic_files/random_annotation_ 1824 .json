I've had terrible haircuts because the stylist didn't have the knowledge to cut my funky asian hair and didn't inform me of that. Unfortunately not all salon schools or hair stylists learn to cut all types of hair. If she was being racist I'm sorry. Personally i wouldn't want to support her business because either she's racist or needs more training.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0298,"user_ideo":-0.6398,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":2},{"user_id":1443975398950222,"comment_id":10153847285413525,"date":"2016-07-19","message":"I wish these images didn't make me sad.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.042,"user_ideo":-0.8638,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":3},{"user_id":10208728495507124,"comment_id":10154344209861756,"date":"2016-04-12","message":"I'd defect too.

But with that said, everything they said made it look like it was the Patriots that were firing with rifles, when all the shooting was the FBI snipers and cops. It is heartbreaking how low our country has become. How people are not rallying around this to stop the injustices. As to the other folks, sharpton etc of course they will not be there. #1. Those folks are white. #2. They are Obama henchmen and this is an order from Obama to create this situation. He needs the conflict/civil unrest to declare Marshall law. The race baiting is not working because we, the whites, used words not force to fight back.
