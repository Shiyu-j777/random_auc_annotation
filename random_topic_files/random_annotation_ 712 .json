Propping it up as a exclusively Jewish artifact because it's in Hebrew (as if Palestinian history can't include the Jewish history of Palestine) is as absurd as the denigration of Arabic as a non-Jewish language, when in fact some of the great works of Jewish philosophy and poetry are in Arabic. To draw nationalist, sectarian lines around complex, multifaceted cultural products ignores the deep connections of all peoples in the region.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0009,"user_ideo":-0.6187,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":3},{"user_id":10105948041494068,"comment_id":10153257767548721,"date":"2015-10-10","message":"Men's nipples are not R-rated.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0362,"user_ideo":-0.3039,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":4},{"user_id":10210619334897764,"comment_id":10153817233713188,"date":"2015-12-16","message":"Maybe ...
