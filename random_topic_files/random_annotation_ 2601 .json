They made monopolized the Pgh grocery market by cutting Krogers, A&Ps and Foodlands throats with really low prices and now the that their competition is all gone, they've raised their prices to the roof! And you people who think that ge's fuel perks are a good deal need to buy some swampland in Fla. But, they are buddies with the the local and state leftist politicians, so their legally questionable business tactics will never be scrutinized... >>NEVER BUY AT GIANT TURD-BIRD STORES<<","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9928,"user_ideo":0.0427,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":1},{"user_id":1451796514837865,"comment_id":10153438419208067,"date":"2016-02-29","message":"Mohsin Rasheed","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0492,"user_ideo":-0.3676,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":2},{"user_id":1530012083690696,"comment_id":1176424782398378,"date":"2016-01-21","message":"Faith in action.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2607,"user_ideo":-0.6862,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":3},{"user_id":1223129684388477,"comment_id":10157690074230725,"date":"2016-09-14","message":"women~STOP running alone!!!!!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1399,"user_ideo":-0.578,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":4},{"user_id":635395553286169,"comment_id":10155393878643797,"date":"2017-02-01","message":"\"\"\"\"maybe it just might of be against the law.. \"\"\"\" Yet no proof, no evidence, just speculation based on ignorance and hate.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0558,"user_ideo":0.1468,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":5},{"user_id":874520045987808,"comment_id":10153881049261378,"date":"2016-08-11","message":"Next up.....
