Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it.

Second-- if that store is MAKING MONEY they also won't close a store. How many walmarts across this nation are dry and they still make money. (Let me answer that for you HUNDREDS.) So before you start bashing a retailer that brings more revenue and jobs than most other retailers in that community id say you are a bunch of ungrateful residence.
