Over the phone as well and get mad because we show up frequently. Then they attempt to minimize the amount of time we speak. Trust not all parents avoid a teacher and not all teachers as well as schools these days care about their students like they portray.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1515,"user_ideo":-0.635,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":1},{"user_id":10154314474742429,"comment_id":10155102720168487,"date":"2017-02-10","message":"Because they lie","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6011,"user_ideo":-0.6442,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":2},{"user_id":10154479327414630,"comment_id":10154806287406756,"date":"2016-09-28","message":"Get real","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8225,"user_ideo":0.8207,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":3},{"user_id":1242456545790350,"comment_id":10157031940425294,"date":"2016-05-11","message":"I'd use that 100 dollars to bet on how long the marriage is gonna last","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3256,"user_ideo":-0.3659,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":4},{"user_id":1833875526845609,"comment_id":1575963419323756,"date":"2015-12-25","message":"It's GOD IS GOOD!!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7626,"user_ideo":-0.0073,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":5},{"user_id":10210472940163486,"comment_id":10153506699448908,"date":"2015-08-11","message":"Cool, thanks, Amanda - a guy from work is getting hammered by it at the moment!

The demand for manual labor in the \"\"\"\"new\"\"\"\" world that was being stolen from its rightful owners created this demand and created a huge market for slaves. It is very unlikely that without this demand there would have been much less abductions among Africans for that purpose. The primary criminals, and this is irrefutable, were the Christians with their need for cheap manual labor in America.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0071,"user_ideo":-0.5528,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":7},{"user_id":2205893422968507,"comment_id":10154264498396323,"date":"2016-06-17","message":"Ha ha , brilliant , probably are , but more importantly it's great to see that there are still Guardian readers (?) who retain their humour.
