There are many full out in the open gay and lesbian kids at her school. Many times it's difficult to figure out which ones are boys and girls. We live in a sheltered small town and in the heart of the Bible Belt, go to church, husband/her dad is a worship leader. Her best friend's parents were so distraught, they moved about a week ago. We are struggling to keep our daughter grounded. She still wears girly clothes, has long hair, wears makeup, and giggles around cute boys. I KNOW she is NOT gay! The open acceptance has caused our kids to be descensatized and confused. Our college (University of TN) has decided to add a bunch of unisex bathrooms. I'm ok with diversity, but this is going way too far!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8639,"user_ideo":0.6975,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":895},{"user_id":10154300302721142,"comment_id":1839474409601541,"date":"2016-10-21","message":"Ms. Cortinhas, I could care less if she is a woman, so don't claim you know the reason people are voting for her. The fact she is NOT Donald Trump, is the reason I would vote for her. If you choose to IGNORE the facts of Donald Trump which I could present you with a \"\"\"\"laundry list\"\"\"\" twice the size of the one you gave us then by all means you vote for him. There are quite a few items on that list I could put down that Mr. Trump has presented to us in the last year during the campaign. I don't see one item on your list of Ms. Clinton's that is recent. Mr. Trump is a racist bigot who demeans women, those that are disabled, those of different sexual orientations, people of color and those of different religions, which is exactly the backbone of this country. If he doesn't get his way, he pouts and blames every one else. I am sorry that is not the kind of leader I want for my country.
