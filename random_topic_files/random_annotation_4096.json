Funny. Not only is the choice of venue to capture cowardly, they are taking children into the building so they can hide behind them! Such brave men! But language matters! You need to use the proper term for these people. They are domestic treasonous terrorists. They are not a peaceful assembly of protest- those don't involve carrying weapons- and they are not a militia. A militia is a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. It is not separatists taking up arms against the lawful government. Taking up arms against the government is treason. So these people are not only terrorists, but are committing treason. Every person over the age of 18 who enters that building needs to be held acountable for their treasonous acts. Every adult or adults who take a minor into that building need to be declared unfit parents and lose parental rights for extreme child endangerment.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0045,"user_ideo":-0.4819,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":7},{"user_id":10209041207761849,"comment_id":10153760400052061,"date":"2016-07-19","message":"Something's wrong here, the nose of the paddle board hardly moves!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5474,"user_ideo":0.4647,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":8},{"user_id":10154416539419207,"comment_id":1035283406528804,"date":"2015-10-01","message":"Daniel Thoren-Cunningham","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0976,"user_ideo":-0.3345,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":9},{"user_id":1348627718497852,"comment_id":10153274048266770,"date":"2016-02-01","message":"Shows what kind of people vote for this lying , murdering POS.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9989,"user_ideo":0.639,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":10},{"user_id":10209837242828925,"comment_id":10153747253236336,"date":"2015-10-09","message":"It sickens me that POTUS is forcing himself on this community!
