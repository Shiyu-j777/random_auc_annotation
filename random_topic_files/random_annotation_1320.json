Lost on a decision to Oliver North, later of Iran Contra fame, while Webb went on to win a Navy Cross in Vietnam. Webb's a warrior. Not temperamentally suited to government service, let alone elective office. Should stick to writing novels though I suspect he's spent as a writer, nothing more to say. Fields of Fire, his first novel, is very good, said by many to be the very best Vietnam war novel. I thought it was great but wouldn't go that far. Interesting guy. Talk about authenticity? Webb has it over them all, perhaps to a fault.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0422,"user_ideo":-0.4739,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1320},{"user_id":10202985784563291,"comment_id":10155322739883797,"date":"2017-01-11","message":"Did not like many decisions or policies, but Joe, u are the kind of guy I would want in my foxhole when the bombs and bullets are flying","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.848,"user_ideo":0.3884,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1320},{"user_id":10154282474747165,"comment_id":10153279424286509,"date":"2015-01-18","message":"Why can't this be about world peace and harmony without making it political.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6595,"user_ideo":0.3138,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1320},{"user_id":10154664810742448,"comment_id":1416993998341454,"date":"2016-09-21","message":"Laura, Steve, Phil, Katie, Tom - now you really CAN turn someone into...aaaaa treeee! ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0332,"user_ideo":-0.0472,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1320},{"user_id":10210184403266221,"comment_id":1023376311101626,"date":"2017-01-12","message":"Can't wait to see Obama's butt out the door!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.999,"user_ideo":0.7149,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":227,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1320},{"user_id":1259437860787309,"comment_id":737136513143593,"date":"2016-01-26","message":"See there really is a God!
