During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said. He added that accusations of incitement and the closure of media offices must not occur without due process. Haim Shibi, a member of the foreign relations committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of ¡°turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually portraying the IDF [Israeli army] as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills them.¡±","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0372,"user_ideo":-0.5781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":6},{"user_id":1241955592513246,"comment_id":10153027740226336,"date":"2015-03-03","message":"Amy I hope you are correct but taking it back is going to be a lot harder than we think--there have been so many illegals allowed in and so many welfare people until the working class is just about gone under--and depending who is elected in the next election is really going to count.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9957,"user_ideo":0.6627,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":7},{"user_id":10210380557863379,"comment_id":10154492136359087,"date":"2017-01-21","message":"There goes any respect I had for the YMCA, are you afraid of trump?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1178,"user_ideo":-0.4317,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":8},{"user_id":1161142490572654,"comment_id":10153184822036130,"date":"2015-07-03","message":"No. The wanting is ok.
