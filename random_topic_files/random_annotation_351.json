Bush limited public access to presidential records. The order, No. 13233, was issued by Mr. Bush in 2001. It expanded the power of current and former chief executives â€” and their heirs â€” to restrict access to their official records. Last year the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation that would have gutted the order, but the measure ran into resistance in the Senate. The House took up the issue again this month.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0374,"user_ideo":0.4536,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":140,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":351},{"user_id":1255193104513518,"comment_id":10153525939831770,"date":"2016-05-25","message":"Just down right theft.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.538,"user_ideo":0.8662,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":351},{"user_id":10209954717773874,"comment_id":1113587315348406,"date":"2015-09-02","message":"Missouri is a redneck republican state.. or Hillybilly's","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1062,"user_ideo":-0.8317,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":351},{"user_id":1037268612977253,"comment_id":10154651577653812,"date":"2016-08-05","message":"Holy Jaun you might as well do it, because your stupidity is in the same category as his supporters (no offense ), maybe some.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.037,"user_ideo":-0.307,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":19,"json_serial_number":351},{"user_id":288569898168315,"comment_id":10153635399461680,"date":"2016-06-28","message":"At least her job plan by the republicans said would actually work now when her job plan is better than the one your candidate is putting up.
