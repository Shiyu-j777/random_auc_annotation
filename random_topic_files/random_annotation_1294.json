Well, give me one reason why Americans should trust Republicans. They haven't shown the best judgement when choosing our leaders. George W.

Then he lied us into Iraq and sent close to 4500 brave American soldiers to their deaths. Republicans responded by flocking to the polls to re-elect him. So again, please tell me why Americans should trust Republicans?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"user_ideo":-0.6146,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":20,"json_serial_number":1294}]
