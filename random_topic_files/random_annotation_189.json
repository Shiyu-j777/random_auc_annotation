The English were broke and exhausted by the war but wanted to protect their shipping route to their colony India. This was before oil entered the picture. The Zionists convinced Balfour and England that if England created a new country for them that they would serve as England's strongman in the Middle East and do the bulk of the fighting that needed to be done. For Oil America joined later destroying Iran's Democratic government and partnered with England in funding the recently created nation of Israel and their military maneuvers. Israel has become Americas most expensive Military base. The \"\"\"\"Balfour Declaration\"\"\"\" was the official beginning of the forming of the country we now call Israel. Israel became a recognized country by the UN in 1948. Sadly the oil companies who toppled Iran's Democracy and worse do not want peace in the Middle East as it would kill their profits. If the people of the Middle East got a fair deal for their oil it would take money out of the pockets of the oil companies. I know it's disturbing but Israel is a pawn in the never ending exploitation of Middle Eastern resources. If it didn't serve England's military desires England never would have created Isreal. Obviously it is difficult to discuss such an inflammatory part of ongoing history where so many innocent people have died. The true horror comes from the oil companies not the People of Israel, but the Oil companies do use Israel to their own ends and Israel gets lots of funding for their trouble.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.004,"user_ideo":-0.7727,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10209296768728482,"comment_id":10153675557471077,"date":"2016-02-02","message":"Oh the grandkids will be so happy","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6969,"user_ideo":0.4568,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":519859141540109,"comment_id":10152945394202377,"date":"2015-08-04","message":"they are both asswholes that's wat they got in common","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5622,"user_ideo":-0.8956,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":227,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10209202885523560,"comment_id":1128265100579333,"date":"2016-08-15","message":"This isn't the 70's crap this is crap intentionally created by our govt and George Soros, etc","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9949,"user_ideo":0.8072,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":261,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10201700907959826,"comment_id":978383268874407,"date":"2015-08-21","message":"Not true...stupid man..","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4599,"user_ideo":-0.6403,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":1379864752043731,"comment_id":653985334726059,"date":"2016-12-12","message":"I agree","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8285,"user_ideo":0.3446,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10210359711220506,"comment_id":1071219242899086,"date":"2015-03-26","message":"Cristian Montt Tuto xx","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0179,"user_ideo":-0.4045,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10210318123419150,"comment_id":10153152117151051,"date":"2015-07-14","message":"God bless","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8677,"user_ideo":0.5335,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":160,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":1152522861481328,"comment_id":10153336140328188,"date":"2015-05-25","message":"Barbara Ann it looks like a motorcycle with 4 big wheels.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5219,"user_ideo":0.853,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":164,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10106035096754755,"comment_id":10153488216401028,"date":"2016-02-08","message":"It's sad that people aren't knowledgeable about inflation....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1031,"user_ideo":-0.5079,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":1389177021097455,"comment_id":10153535792365496,"date":"2016-05-25","message":"Anyone want to bet money Georgia backs out when the NFL says the Super Bowl won't be in Atlanta due to the lawsuit.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4646,"user_ideo":0.3306,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10206989084145928,"comment_id":10153816610136336,"date":"2015-11-06","message":"Satan knew the prophecy of Jesus and inspired the Egyptians to believe such things and to distract them and others.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9006,"user_ideo":0.4117,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10210124339254977,"comment_id":10153150361239087,"date":"2015-08-24","message":"Biden/Warren 2016 YASSSSSS","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0219,"user_ideo":-0.718,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":189},{"user_id":10101735766626774,"comment_id":922948084427261,"date":"2015-08-25","message":"Spot on Monica.
