A leak or spill could send oil directly into the tribeâ€s main source of drinking water. The tribe points out that Dakota Access originally considered a route farther north, upstream of Bismarck, but the company rejected that route, in part, because of the close proximity to the state capitalâ€s drinking-water wells. Second, the tribe argues that the pipeline would run through a stretch of land north of the reservation that contains recently discovered sacred sites and burial places. True, this land isnâ€t part of the current reservation. But the Standing Rock Sioux argue that the land had been taken away from them unjustly over the past 150 years. And any bulldozing and construction work could damage these sites.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0893,"user_ideo":-0.3698,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":616},{"user_id":1759177440994931,"comment_id":10153882178862377,"date":"2016-10-25","message":"You should have been a priest Rick.
