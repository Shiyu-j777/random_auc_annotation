Then soon after, he went professional. May weather fought PAC man the way he fought all 47 of his prior matches. Box weave, move, defend and counter punch. Y'all know his game plan, he brags about it, he shows y'all on his hbo/show time pre fight series, he let his dad, mom, uncle and he even let his TMT crew tell y'all his plan so y'all won't get nothing confused - and yall still can't do nothing about it. Pacman / Freddie Roach, you had your chance and you actually thought he was going to stand toe to toe with you and brawl like a fighter. Naw - mayweather is an elite, elusive and exceptional boxer who just boxed and received $125,000 per second for 12 rounds (Very Easy Day at the Office). You got to be impressed with his genius.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1541,"user_ideo":-0.4986,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":49},{"user_id":1154870914570146,"comment_id":10154096944892550,"date":"2016-07-25","message":"It's hard to feel sorry for someone this stupid.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4119,"user_ideo":0.2648,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":49},{"user_id":963518147079761,"comment_id":10153494331191051,"date":"2016-01-01","message":"So nice","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6267,"user_ideo":0.6269,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":160,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":49},{"user_id":632665136905298,"comment_id":1196065737071710,"date":"2016-05-02","message":"Fire them all.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7839,"user_ideo":0.8417,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":236,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":49},{"user_id":317591075252059,"comment_id":10154509849595695,"date":"2016-07-06","message":"Its not a good idea to swim in lakes ,rivers,oceans,you simply cannot see the bottom or how deep it is or see the currents.Wear life jackets...be careful..LIFE IS FRAGILE.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5613,"user_ideo":0.3047,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":206,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":49},{"user_id":1412815635400242,"comment_id":10154019056017452,"date":"2016-11-21","message":"Read the entire article.
