I believe criminal charges are in order. We do have a class action suit already filed and this will guarantee us that we win that! If you have not seen the emails there are thousands of them showing collusion with the media to promote Hillary and even plans to protect themselves from 'looking like' they were committing election fraud ie the actual primary elections and there are many lawsuits filed re the election fraud and voter suppression around the country in favor of Hillary Clinton. The American People Should Be PISSED OFF And DEMAND JUSTICE! Hilary will NEVER Become President and if the DNC has ANY sense, which obviously they don't have much... they will NOT nominate Hillary Clinton and instead Nominate Bernie Sanders who would have won without the election fraud and voter suppression and clearly would have done EVEN BETTER if the DNC has not committed Fraud against Him/US! #NeverHillary #NeverTrump If you don't nominate Bernie WE ARE GOING GREEN! Most people are planning to leave the party after this convention.... I do hope criminal charges are filed. DNC is considered a 'private company' and as such holding a national contest and then rigging it for one particular winner is illegal....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":-0.3512,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":2},{"user_id":543144282536118,"comment_id":746273175563260,"date":"2016-02-10","message":"He's already ruined it!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8811,"user_ideo":0.8254,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":3},{"user_id":10211970072037744,"comment_id":1076688032351552,"date":"2016-02-14","message":"For one I can hardly vote on any american policy as I am not a citizen of the states. Nor I have agreed with their foreign policy. Nor are the States the pillar and only example of democracy. Your argument is that because there is no direct democracy, a totalitarian dictatorship is a better choice? Again why are you here? In these capitalist evil world we are living in. There is a better one, you just need to buy a ticket, the good state of NK will take care of the rest. Just go to the custom office and say you hate America and the western capitalist pigs and you are set.

Richard Grossi, of Milford, died at age 55 on October 21, 2009. Joshua Fromer, of Lynn, died at age 19 on August 23, 2005. He was killed in a motorcycle crash with an illegal alien with prior violations. Scott Coxell, of Waltham, died at age 39 on November 23, 2011. He was run over in a crosswalk by a car that police believe was driven by an illegal alien unlicensed driver who fled the scene. She was charged, but later retracted her confession. Her boyfriend claimed responsibility, but escaped prosecution because authorities had no evidence that he was responsible. Sara Escudero, of Stoughton, died at age 64 on June 24, 2013. She was killed while driving to her job as a nurse by an illegal alien visa overstayer who was driving drunk and unlicensed after a night of partying. Ashton Cline-McMurray, of Boston, died at age 16 on October 13, 2000. He was killed by a group of Asian Tiny Rascals gang members, including at least one illegal alien from Cambodia, named Loeun Heng. After Cambodia refused to accept Heng for deportation and ICE had to release him six months later according to the terms of aSupreme Court ruling, the case brought national attention to the problem of court-ordered criminal alien releases, which now number in the thousands, including more than 100 convicted murderers like Heng.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9835,"user_ideo":0.7519,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":9},{"user_id":1582107655136980,"comment_id":10155803503621509,"date":"2016-12-24","message":"Cute kid!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4411,"user_ideo":0.1139,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":10},{"user_id":10206994968574517,"comment_id":899048196810395,"date":"2015-09-04","message":"it's great...love christmas season","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5785,"user_ideo":0.6408,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":11},{"user_id":1057164561003962,"comment_id":645112572345988,"date":"2015-08-24","message":"There is absolutely NO reason anyone should be subjected to her face, ever.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3042,"user_ideo":0.71,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":12},{"user_id":10210371192902078,"comment_id":10153946211564607,"date":"2016-09-28","message":"Because they are racist and messy...it's a lot of things they can do and say to create peace and harmony","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1451,"user_ideo":-0.3356,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":13},{"user_id":606349259537690,"comment_id":484077128464957,"date":"2016-01-08","message":"have u ever owned a ranch u wouldn't joke or make light about it.
