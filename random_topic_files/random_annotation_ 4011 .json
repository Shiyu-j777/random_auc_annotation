The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":8},{"user_id":1237814366253142,"comment_id":10153074863094497,"date":"2015-01-06","message":"Hahaha satire at its bowserrist","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0976,"user_ideo":-0.5051,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":9},{"user_id":646533658878106,"comment_id":989341911100904,"date":"2016-02-02","message":"I thought Anonymous was supposed to attack the central power that holds us in tyranny.rapists racists and shop lifters are all criminals .But so is hacking.Anonymous ,you will lose the public's backing unless you focus your minds and attention on the the single goal of removing the oppressor.ill even tell you their names to get you started Banks and institutions owned by ,rockefeller,rothschild ford,etc","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.137,"user_ideo":-0.2873,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":10},{"user_id":638433073015454,"comment_id":10153504610284342,"date":"2015-12-04","message":"Gratulations Hunter Pence","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9077,"user_ideo":0.1218,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":11},{"user_id":10205974834322253,"comment_id":10152954374031336,"date":"2015-02-07","message":"Sounds like Armenia, by the story.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1479,"user_ideo":0.6475,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":12},{"user_id":10206316785948417,"comment_id":10153970536365927,"date":"2017-01-03","message":"What planet is he on?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6974,"user_ideo":0.6842,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":13},{"user_id":1093962907361614,"comment_id":10153078224944701,"date":"2015-02-02","message":"I got Athena??","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2605,"user_ideo":0.8313,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":14},{"user_id":10154106857032025,"comment_id":10154654259158812,"date":"2016-08-06","message":"Helping people by bombing them...what an idea?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0365,"user_ideo":-0.3905,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":15},{"user_id":234530120350547,"comment_id":10154393813084071,"date":"2017-02-18","message":"ðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤§ðŸ˜­ My Jiho must be very sad now ðŸ¤§","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0602,"user_ideo":-0.0041,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":16},{"user_id":1212667975430293,"comment_id":10154374419641336,"date":"2016-06-17","message":"your a big man lance!
