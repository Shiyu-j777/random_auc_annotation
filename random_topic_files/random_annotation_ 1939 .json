Human chimeras were first discovered with the advent of blood typing when it was found that some people had more than one blood type. Most of them proved to be \"\"\"\"blood chimeras\"\"\"\" -- non-identical twins who shared a blood supply in the uterus. Those who were not twins are thought to have blood cells from a twin that died early in gestation.
