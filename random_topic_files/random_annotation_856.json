You have *some* cops that act like they are above the law. Regardless if someone is a drug dealer or has priors, they do not deserve to die. That is not a decision that any cop or authority should make. We have a judicial system in place that does the deciding for us. Because of this, all cops get a bad rep. Think about the 2 innocent cops that died in ny a few months ago. For what? Because of the sterotypes that are created by the actions of the few. Meanwhile thousands of cops risk their lives everyday and no one focuses on that. Instead we publicize the ones that commited crimes. On the flip side you have a black man that dies. Regardless of his innocence he should not have died. Convicted for his track record? Yes. But not killed. After all these similar cases that have occured across our nation, you have an entire race scared and angry. Not that their anger is not justifiable. But looting and violent riots are not the solution. Just because the people looting are black doesnt mean they had a right to commit crimes themselves last night. You destroyed the businesses that serve you everyday. You destroyed the community you live in. And now what? Everyone is condemning you and making the entire black community look like violent people when that is so far from the truth. What about the peaceful protesters last night? We dramatize and publicize the violence because it is sensational. A group of black community members protesting the unfortunate death of a young man is not enough for the ratings. This is larger than one community. This is a nationwide issue. Not all cops or black Americans are bad! Reading the comments today and seeing so much hate against both sides is disgusting. How can the country progress and ever move away from the division when people are filled with so much hate? Hold the percentage of bad cops accountable. Stop glorifying people for looting saying it is necessary. It didnt change anything in ferguson. It wont change anything now.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0787,"user_ideo":-0.6384,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":856},{"user_id":10211769878631686,"comment_id":10153459899091756,"date":"2015-05-04","message":"Good summation of the almost death of Mad Men.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0987,"user_ideo":-0.2387,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":100,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":856},{"user_id":1736206196642570,"comment_id":10153665362154342,"date":"2016-02-18","message":"Wow... ABC 13 really? Do y'all hate cops or do you report things with headlines like this to continue to stir the cop hating pot?? This man JUMPED, he didn't fall, wasn't pushed... JUMPED! He wanted to end his life. Maybe the officers themselves couldn't swim? And with all the gear on would have likely drowned themselves. A duty rig on average weighs 30+ pounds, boots, uniforms, badges, etc. not only do you not want cops defending their lives, you want them to further risk their lives for somebody who obviously doesn't want to live. The family that thinks deputies should have done more... Ok well what did you do to prevent his suicide? Obviously he had a mental issue or emotional issue or something. Why not quit blaming cops and look at your own relationship with your family member. It's sad for anybody to lose their life, sad when anybody feels that death is better than life. It's tragic for for everybody involved. But how are you gonna say somebody else should have done more? And to the person who was allegedly filming this whole thing go down, obviously capturing deputies allegedly not doing anything, was more important to you or you would have tried.... I really wish the media would quit breeding hate, and negativity for law enforcement. One day, peace officers are gonna get fed up with this police brutality crap, unable to defend their own lives because it will make the news as they were wrong, and racist, and oppressive and quit. Then The looting, and burnings and riots we saw in Baltimore and Ferguson will run rampant across the nation, murder, and rape, and burglaries, and other crime will skyrocket until good people are afraid to go out side. It will be like \"\"\"\"the purge\"\"\"\" but everyday. Nobody will be being saved, no criminals brought to justice... Keep it up ABC 13. Why not report on the BPP protests in Austin where they are calling for the killing of white law enforcement officer? Why not report on our foreign AND domestic terrorism that is a real threat? Because you don't care about important issues, you care about ratings and fanning the flame of civil unrest","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9318,"user_ideo":0.4536,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":206,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":856},{"user_id":10154432901723934,"comment_id":10153150399906336,"date":"2015-04-12","message":"There was never bad decisions made..
