During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said. He added that accusations of incitement and the closure of media offices must not occur without due process. Haim Shibi, a member of the foreign relations committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of ¡°turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually portraying the IDF [Israeli army] as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills them.¡±","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0372,"user_ideo":-0.5781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":2},{"user_id":10154785743177745,"comment_id":10154073115477690,"date":"2016-08-31","message":"Martin Eduardo Sanchez","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0866,"user_ideo":0.1283,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":3},{"user_id":10154299928601675,"comment_id":10154684498146509,"date":"2016-04-13","message":"That would be the start of WW3.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.75,"user_ideo":-0.2252,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":4},{"user_id":10210815519330812,"comment_id":1067362699987541,"date":"2015-12-03","message":"Travis, that shows about how much research you have done.
