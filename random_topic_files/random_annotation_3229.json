But yes my default setting for why America is so disliked by so many and why American lives are endangered are the influences of 1 AIPAC and Israel and idiot evangelicals (Cruz&Rubio voters etc),2 Neo Cons as you say and 3 politicians financed by the U.S. arms industry. These three overlap each other greatly to the extent of almost being indistinguishable from each other. And before you sound like the idiots on FOX and crazily equate anti-zionism with anti-semitism, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that does not fall into 1 or more of these groups and his human decency and intelligence are why almost all non african american muslims in your country support him","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0006,"user_ideo":-0.3881,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":3},{"user_id":1223129684388477,"comment_id":10157690074230725,"date":"2016-09-14","message":"women~STOP running alone!!!!!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1399,"user_ideo":-0.578,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":4},{"user_id":286140651749211,"comment_id":10154771025593812,"date":"2016-09-09","message":"But you only have so much info to work with.

I was in the middle of having another stroke! Linda called my son who met us half way to the hospital and received treatment. However, i learned later to NEVER do that - call 911 instead. As soon as they arrive the EMT's begin treatment, forwarding vitals to the hospital, etc. and saves ER admittance time, also.
