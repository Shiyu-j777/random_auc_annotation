Men and women are innately hard wired a little differently since our most primitive days dating as far back as the cave men. Of course there are exceptions. Our privative hard wiring has allowed us to \"\"\"\"gather\"\"\"\". With one walk in the forest we knew what fruits were in season, where the best places to find water, what the birds were avoiding, etc. Men are wired to hunt. If wired to gather they would lose site of their prey. Hence why men are always so amazed that we can tell them exactly where they put their wallet, where their shoes are, how many socks they have in the top drawer, etc.. We don't take inventory of these things but with walks around the room our minds are constantly \"\"\"\"gathering\"\"\"\". Not implying we are more social. Being social is a personality trait that a man or woman may have. Culturally we are also wired to trust women more. Most cultures are like that. Take all these things into account and you have someone who could possibly gain the enemy's trust and \"\"\"\"gather\"\"\"\" loads of information a lot more readily. Pretty cool if you ask me.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2279,"user_ideo":-0.297,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":201},{"user_id":1818538241746847,"comment_id":10153782461713869,"date":"2016-06-08","message":"I like her every thing ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘ ðŸ‘","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5788,"user_ideo":-0.2782,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":201},{"user_id":1810485005854925,"comment_id":655312837992628,"date":"2015-09-09","message":"Go gettem.i girl.still would like u to become vice president","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9873,"user_ideo":0.8446,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":163,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":201},{"user_id":1364372950258400,"comment_id":10153507592806756,"date":"2015-05-24","message":"Yep, just let it go, sweetie.
