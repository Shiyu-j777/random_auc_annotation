Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":11},{"user_id":544443532391239,"comment_id":10153111032216094,"date":"2015-08-24","message":"Thats heinous for any American to do.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.661,"user_ideo":-0.7261,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":12},{"user_id":10154326533473418,"comment_id":10152873604001545,"date":"2015-04-25","message":"I got promoted twice while pumping at work.
