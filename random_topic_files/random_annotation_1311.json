But, as to the article, I do admit that I find it confusing how restoring treaty rights and properties, not the whole kit and kaboodle, will end racism and police brutality. If we give the Black Hills back, does that end the brutality in NYC? It's a nonsensical UN report, which I typically ignore out of hand.
