His JOB dictates he follows laws as written. While he did not violate a specific law he enabled others, encouraged others and offered comfort and aid to obvious law breakers thru his office as Sheriff. Upon determining the extent of his participation thru this investigation will determine if charges apply. Either way, the ethics of his oath were broken by his own statements regarding this situation that he so proudly shared on video. Supporters of his actions would not be so quick to support his personal beliefs if they conflicted with their own. As Sheriff, his personal beliefs must be set aside in pursuit of rule of law. Put the shoe on the other foot and contemplate if someday his OPINION on a matter led him to arrest someone based on his OPINION rather than law. This would be fascist. Something we must guard against as a nation with rule of law.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0363,"user_ideo":-0.4904,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":7},{"user_id":1309463332430363,"comment_id":10153258099758908,"date":"2015-05-08","message":"Turmeric is always one ingredience of a spice mixture of some or many different spices.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3402,"user_ideo":-0.3052,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":8},{"user_id":10153546909656534,"comment_id":1636751006628825,"date":"2017-01-21","message":"He was in an interview with Joe Rogan and told him he would prefer not to be gay, that it is not something he likes about himself.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1153,"user_ideo":-0.4379,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":9},{"user_id":1073431219360467,"comment_id":10153535744538010,"date":"2015-07-15","message":"Flat road in L.A ??","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4799,"user_ideo":-0.3979,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":10},{"user_id":1082914031799135,"comment_id":10154139742778067,"date":"2016-12-01","message":"Columbus,Georgia","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8992,"user_ideo":0.4519,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":11},{"user_id":10208677695153687,"comment_id":10154235536013279,"date":"2016-06-21","message":"FYI Ginger Gonsalves-Swigart, Gloria Keegan, Lj Roulet, Dorothy Fine","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0678,"user_ideo":-0.7124,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":12},{"user_id":1203483386368617,"comment_id":10155142567859218,"date":"2017-01-08","message":"The one in Arundel Mills was open Thursday, but it was closed today when I went there.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2637,"user_ideo":0.0923,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":13},{"user_id":10207089558145942,"comment_id":10153766487242522,"date":"2016-10-19","message":"Watching the Liberal Media newscasts and even reading the papers has become a complete waste of my time. What ever happened to 2-source verification. Anything less equates to media bias and false representation. Mainly, the Liberal Media has failed to honestly critique Democratic candidates at least on an equal basis as they do Republican candidates. The Liberal media engages in character assassination and they are doing it to hundreds of decent people across this country who totally reject their political beliefs. Not only is the Liberal Media complacent in character assassination...they are aiding and abetting in it's conduct. Since I disdain everything they stand for, I expect them to continue on with their assaults on Republican candidates across the country. If people want to listen to an believe the trash they spout, then by all means do so. But the Democratic Party sucks...anyone that is one of them and engaged in character assassination sucks, and I for one will never vote for even one Democrat because of it. When they engage in character assassination using deceit and lies...that is what their subjects are voting for to represent them in our government.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.3647,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":14},{"user_id":623903114459122,"comment_id":10152860676559342,"date":"2015-02-16","message":"Love her spirit !","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2177,"user_ideo":0.7503,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":15},{"user_id":10205121530877701,"comment_id":1497580153590881,"date":"2016-11-08","message":"cant catch me","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5517,"user_ideo":-0.5108,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":16},{"user_id":10154270400811422,"comment_id":10152846966843721,"date":"2015-04-01","message":"The point is that there were some beta/developing parts of the game that have been shown, based on which the further development phase would be built, depending on the funding. This is such a misleading article. I'm not even into games, but find this highly offensive from an accurate truth point of view. I do hope the title is meant to be read as a sign of hope, people pay that money because they probably want to see the game be made. How can you expect a fully functional game of that size before putting in considerable amounts of money? Just think of the latest GTA with a 1/4 of a billion funding.
