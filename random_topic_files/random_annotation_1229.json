Because if God wanted us all to be cis and hetero, we would be... oh wait, the fact that we're not all that way would suggest God wants some people to be different.

The USMAP and a degree are fine, but we need certifications. Some MOS have them, but the Corps should institute OJT certifications that correlate to the private sector. Or let the Marine choose a set of certs he would like to attain while in the Marines and what they translate to in the private sector, I don't think TA should cover certs though. That should be what the GI Bill is used for. TA should stay the same and apply to a degree.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7024,"user_ideo":0.4555,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1229},{"user_id":1446080122099442,"comment_id":10153027654888445,"date":"2015-05-06","message":"Damn that's cheap at these fuls in Texas want 300","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.819,"user_ideo":-0.0225,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":225,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1229},{"user_id":827765280687421,"comment_id":1082395615156862,"date":"2016-05-31","message":"Media had nothing else to attack Trump with.
