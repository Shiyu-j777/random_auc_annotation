Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy.

Her decision did not affect you in any way, so why make it personal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0696,"user_ideo":0.6275,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":13},{"user_id":10211775175724149,"comment_id":10154479341802550,"date":"2016-12-07","message":"It's just a ring!
