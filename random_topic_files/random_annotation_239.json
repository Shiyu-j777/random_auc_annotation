They do not make public school uniform wearers wear a sweater at all times. They have short sleeve shirts they can wear. And I never had AC when I was kid at home or school and I always had 30+ kids in my classes. We all made it and turned out just fine. Sure it was hot at times and sure it sucked, but we survived and we even managed to still complete all our work in school and chores at home. Also, temperatures now are no worse than they were then. That is just made up crap people say. While I do think that they should work on getting AC in schools simply just to make it more comfortable and so schools don't have to close when it gets to hot, I also think we are making this generation into a bunch of sissy cry babies who can't handle anything and thinks the whole world should change and revolve around them and what they want. Then when they don't get their way they throw temper tantrums and cause a ruckus. Well it's not a good thing because the real world doesn't work like that. In the real world you have to be tough and have thick skin, be able to endure situations where you may not be the most comfortable and still have to function and do your job, etc.. These kids need to learn this somehow and constantly being pampered isn't teaching them anything.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7634,"user_ideo":0.5508,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":239},{"user_id":1261728537173189,"comment_id":10153031269280950,"date":"2015-08-04","message":"Veronica, I'm sure God on judgement day is going to say to me...
