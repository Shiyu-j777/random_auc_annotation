With our guns are more important than people lives!!!! Does not matter what the age or where the massacre. Guns and the push of the NRA rally every time. Other civilized countries can and do have better laws on gun control. I'm not a paranoid person who sees shadows and someone coming for them at every turn. What I do see are children gunned down, normal every day people at movies gun down, Universities students gun down, Marines gun down, people in a church gun down. This is real life for us now. Not a TV show. We are in a sad state of affairs. It's not the Presidents fault. He has talked and talked upon every slaughter.

Your dismissal of Hillary still doesn't address the fact that Trump is continuing to surround himself with the elite and wealthy. The same persons who use loopholes to avoid contributing taxes to our government, who happily send jobs overseas to improve their bottom line but not the life of citizens in the U.S.. How is Trump going to help make our country better when the people he's working with are practiced at only making the lives of their fellow elite members better first?
