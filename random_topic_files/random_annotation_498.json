The local mill had been on strike for months and many of our men had left for jobs in other places, leaving their families behind to tend the home fires. Few of us had anything extra for gift giving and it was all we could do to make sure that our children did not feel the pinch too badly. We decided to forego the regular extended family gift exchange and instead we set a limit of no more than 1$ per gift, throwing out a challenge for who could find the most creative gift for that amount. It was the most fun and heartfelt Christmas I can remember as we came up with gag gifts, certificates promising our time or offering something special for the recipient. It made a very bleak time just a little brighter and the gifts and laughter exchanged that year were filled with more love than any expensive alternative could possibly have provided.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1786,"user_ideo":-0.4647,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":498},{"user_id":10208736072133688,"comment_id":964723363576952,"date":"2016-01-28","message":"Sorry.

It's only being said do to the fact it's cyber terrorism which can result in world war 3 which is being pushed. Say goodbye to freedom, online you can find agenda 50 which is beyond unrealistic to this world without drilling fear into the public. In 2000 the government wrote a strategy report about increasing national security. Mentions creating another pearl harbor which whether people like or not evidence proves 9/11 was planned. Not only that foreign governments are preparing to release footage to prove it with aerial footage. The way the buildings fell could only be a controlled demolition which is a timely process. The added structures were rigged up and the proof that it was impossible to have destroyed the towers is the clean passport they claimed to be a terrorist. The passport would not have survived a catastrophe such as 9/11 not even in a house fire. Jet fuel burns around 1700 degrees and the building was easily capable of withstanding much more. Now they are providing nessacary fabricated information to drill fear once again to give a reason for world war 3. Which has been already engaged when Obama falsely cyber attacked Russia. Don't let others dictate your thoughts on 3-D dimensional plane , do yourself a favor and connect the dots to see why Killary is a bad option. I could provide nessacary information but the truth will remain the truth and history was not changed because you turn your head to facts.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9332,"user_ideo":-0.2777,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":498},{"user_id":10155076952383916,"comment_id":10153729393588010,"date":"2015-10-04","message":"\"\"\"\"â€¢ The final compromise version of the Brady bill -- an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system -- was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993.
