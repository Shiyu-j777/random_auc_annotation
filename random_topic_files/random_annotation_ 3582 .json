But yes my default setting for why America is so disliked by so many and why American lives are endangered are the influences of 1 AIPAC and Israel and idiot evangelicals (Cruz&Rubio voters etc),2 Neo Cons as you say and 3 politicians financed by the U.S. arms industry. These three overlap each other greatly to the extent of almost being indistinguishable from each other. And before you sound like the idiots on FOX and crazily equate anti-zionism with anti-semitism, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that does not fall into 1 or more of these groups and his human decency and intelligence are why almost all non african american muslims in your country support him","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0006,"user_ideo":-0.3881,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":4},{"user_id":10210650475803321,"comment_id":10152977326777377,"date":"2015-08-19","message":"Hang her high!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8769,"user_ideo":0.8314,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":5},{"user_id":10207349512639102,"comment_id":10154406565393812,"date":"2016-05-15","message":"Is this guy for real!

Be proud of every one of them. You fought the fierce battle and came out a winner! Our seven year old great granddaughter went through open heart surgery and shows off her scar. God is watching over you, Carter, and even though those scars are visible, you have such beauty on the inside. Those scars will fade in time, not all the way, but everytime you see them in the mirror, just remember that when God brings you to it, He will bring you through it. Good luck, young man, our prayers go out to you.

Section 2071 Federal Law: Title 18. Section 2071 Former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey tells MSNBC that not only is Hillary Clinton's private email server illegal, it \"\"\"\"disqualifies\"\"\"\" her from holding any federal office. Such as, say, President of the United States. \"\"\"\"If you do this or that bad thing, you've essentially disqualified yourself as being the leader of the free world,\"\"\"\" said Mukasey, referring to the illegal server and the illegal handling of classified materials. Mukasey specifically points to one federal law, Title 18. Section 2071. For those of us who do not have United States Code committed to memory, here's what it says: Whoever willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, or destroys, or attempts to do so, or, with intent to do so takes and carries away any record, proceeding, map, book, paper, document, or other thing, filed or deposited with any clerk or officer of any court of the United States, or in any public office, or with any judicial or public officer of the United States, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both. Whoever, having the custody of any such record, proceeding, map, book, document, paper, or other thing, willfully and unlawfully conceals, removes, mutilates, obliterates, falsifies, or destroys the same, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both; and shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States. As used in this subsection, the term \"\"\"\"office\"\"\"\" does not include the office held by any person as a retired officer of the Armed Forces of the United States. Yes, it explicitly states \"\"\"\"shall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\"\"\"\" Shouldn't voters know that?
