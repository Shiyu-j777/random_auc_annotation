Be proud of every one of them. You fought the fierce battle and came out a winner! Our seven year old great granddaughter went through open heart surgery and shows off her scar.

Those scars will fade in time, not all the way, but everytime you see them in the mirror, just remember that when God brings you to it, He will bring you through it. Good luck, young man, our prayers go out to you.
