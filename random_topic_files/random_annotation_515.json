So disappointed. My thought is, where do these people think transgender people have been using the bathroom before all of this started? It didn't become a problem to anyone until it was made to be a problem. Here's what I think, I would be more worried to see a woman who identifies as a man, looks like a man, and dresses as a man walk into a woman's bathroom because that was his gender at birth. Explain that to your kids. And then the other, having a woman walk into the men's bathroom. Her safety would be in jeopardy.
