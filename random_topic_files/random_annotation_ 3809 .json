What ever happened to 2-source verification. Anything less equates to media bias and false representation. Mainly, the Liberal Media has failed to honestly critique Democratic candidates at least on an equal basis as they do Republican candidates. The Liberal media engages in character assassination and they are doing it to hundreds of decent people across this country who totally reject their political beliefs. Not only is the Liberal Media complacent in character assassination...they are aiding and abetting in it's conduct. Since I disdain everything they stand for, I expect them to continue on with their assaults on Republican candidates across the country. If people want to listen to an believe the trash they spout, then by all means do so. But the Democratic Party sucks...anyone that is one of them and engaged in character assassination sucks, and I for one will never vote for even one Democrat because of it. When they engage in character assassination using deceit and lies...that is what their subjects are voting for to represent them in our government.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.3647,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":6},{"user_id":10210895594854684,"comment_id":10153946392458908,"date":"2016-03-02","message":"Give them lots of Raw onions they are cancer busting veg--","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8621,"user_ideo":0.6693,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":7},{"user_id":10207983139630415,"comment_id":1131009990310869,"date":"2016-04-06","message":"Funny how Ford calls themselves an American company and yet their founder was a supporter of and provided vehicles to the Nazi Party during WWII.
