It's about listening to music, watching TV, playing video games, and using social media. You can't complain about social media and then turn around and let your kid watch TV for 4 hours a night or play video games until it's bed time. None of this stuff is bad in moderation. My daughter plays Minecraft, listens to music, reads books, plays outside, and watches TV on top of being active in karate and now swimming. Before you knock on the habits of teens, take a look at yourself. My newsfeed is constantly full of people saying they binged watched 2 seasons of some show on Netflix.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.007,"user_ideo":-0.2862,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":11},{"user_id":1029565323829946,"comment_id":10153606906914170,"date":"2015-08-10","message":"Sweet","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6664,"user_ideo":0.83,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":12},{"user_id":10154043978268285,"comment_id":1219994328079101,"date":"2016-08-14","message":"yes 10 points in general election ......you know we vote via electrol college.

One group with one agenda. Than the media covers content to keep the next group blind. Many of her base are in conflict with one another and an open forum would be detrimental to her campaign. Her campaign is now in trouble as her numbers drop and sanders rise if Bernie goes for the jugular she will bleed like a stuck hog. Her campaign is deception, and Bernie, and trump could bring this out as they are both on the inside.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5531,"user_ideo":0.829,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":20}]
