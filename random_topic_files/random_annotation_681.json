But you're absolutely right! Taco bell not having equipment to accommodate every single disability is extreme and unrealistic. It sounds more like the person doing the suing did it on purpose. I teach American Sign and unless every fast food company sends every employee to school to learn sign, then have video capabilities at their order Windows, how did this person assume anyone would be able to communicate at the ordering window. It's unfortunate to be deaf, but if this frivolous lawsuit happens, every handicap person will want something else. Its tax payers who pay for all those changes. Taco bell isn't in any violation of the disability act of 1964. They aren't liable. What ppl wanting to sue whomever don't understand , for every frivolous law suit, IF one makes it to a trial, it is paid for by tax payers, not the person suing, not the company or other person(s) being sued. Tax paying people do. 2nd, it's not taco bell or other individuals on trial, it's that constitution that suffers. For every action is a reaction with end results causing changes to whatever state those ppl live and that states constitution. Even though most state constitutions run close to our US Constitution, the state and every person who lives in which ever state suffer all because a deaf person didn't want to start out going inside whose got unrealistic expectations! She should a went to burger king!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7654,"user_ideo":0.3334,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":5,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":681},{"user_id":10206880187512379,"comment_id":10153133158190667,"date":"2015-10-29","message":"We Democrats will keep the White House.
