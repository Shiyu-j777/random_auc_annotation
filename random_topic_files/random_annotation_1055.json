Who is to blame for Dems getting MOPPED in midterm elections because of Obama policies? Were Dem politicians who wouldn't allow him on the campaign trail also bigots? You are simply a propaganda puppet and just turned this comment into your own dramatic agenda.

You are even stretching your own BS agenda playing the Bigot card on this one! PS...since you are obviously political and cultural experts, how is Al Sharpton doing?
