During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said. He added that accusations of incitement and the closure of media offices must not occur without due process. Haim Shibi, a member of the foreign relations committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of ¡°turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually portraying the IDF [Israeli army] as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills them.¡±","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0372,"user_ideo":-0.5781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":14},{"user_id":10210476214804612,"comment_id":10154450205353128,"date":"2016-07-04","message":"have u even tried it yet?
