The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":9},{"user_id":1777562972462164,"comment_id":10153556547573690,"date":"2015-07-04","message":"It's not right for any group to destroy archaeological treasures of any kind.

Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":11},{"user_id":10210407001719173,"comment_id":10153952484034497,"date":"2016-01-13","message":"Eli Johnson Ralking!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1073,"user_ideo":-0.6166,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":12},{"user_id":1054416781334684,"comment_id":10153521227531756,"date":"2015-05-29","message":"So... like Bitcoin?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1062,"user_ideo":-0.5581,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":13},{"user_id":10206619332341993,"comment_id":10155823723005354,"date":"2015-07-03","message":"Live trump","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9809,"user_ideo":0.8655,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":14},{"user_id":1389329781100024,"comment_id":784934968272671,"date":"2016-07-14","message":"Lost in shipping?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3418,"user_ideo":-0.7299,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":15},{"user_id":1014733235261658,"comment_id":10154122091316320,"date":"2016-03-16","message":"Trade him for some American liberal who hates this country","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9975,"user_ideo":0.7404,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":16},{"user_id":1126132137433571,"comment_id":10153358109123701,"date":"2015-05-09","message":"Joseph I am sorry for all the jerks who treat others with disrespect.
