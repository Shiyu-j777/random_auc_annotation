Steve Harvey did not have to stay and apologize, but he did and he owned up to his error. He quickly acted on the error and made what was wrong to a right. Steve Harvey corrected it before he was even told by the production company during the show last night. Interesting, I just watched this yesterday, prior to the pageant, on Oprah's Super Soul Sunday with Bren√© Brown talking about what is trust, and accountability was one of the traits. How can you trust someone if that person cannot be accountable for his or her own actions? The producers of the pageant immediately forgave Steve Harvey for what he did because on his own he corrected the wrong and took accountability for his human era, therefore this production company will support him through this matter. And most likely Steve Harvey will continue to work with the organization in the future. Now that's all over, let's get back to our regularly schedule program.
