Granted,the press conference was not his best moment but you're wrong about Cam Newton. He could have and should have been more gracious but I honestly can't blame him for leaving the press conference. You probably don't know the history but suffice it to say the media has not been kind to Cam during his college or NFL career. Maybe you didn't see it because of the crowd but he went right over to Manning and shook his hand and congratulated him after the game. Cam Newton is a good man who loves the Lord and does a lot of good work in the community. He spends much of his time off the field helping children in need. He's well aware that the eyes of children are on him at all times. I've been a fan of Cam's since his Auburn days and I have watched him grow in maturity year after year. He went back to Auburn and took classes in the off seasons and earned his degree last year,keeping a promise to his mother. I have no doubt as long as he keeps God first he will continue to grow as a man and he will continue to make the lives of other people better wherever he goes. #KeepPounding #WarCamEagle","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9939,"user_ideo":0.7767,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":851},{"user_id":1098712773542959,"comment_id":842755239106358,"date":"2015-05-03","message":"Sugar Ray and Duran all over again.
