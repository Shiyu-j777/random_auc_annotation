As the EV market becomes real with real competition, what they are doing is validated. GM is notorious for producing cars that produce good bullet points, but drive poorly and break down early (or has something changed recently?), a nice competitor to have.

And you are also wrong about Brazilians, all we want is all corrupted people to pay for their crimes.
