The Electoral College can, based on grounds that can be carefully circumscribed, do the following: -- It can protect our election against well-established foreign influence. -- It can avoid a clear and unanswered constitutional violation that will result from the election of one candidate. (See, e.g. foreign diplomats booking the Trump DC hotel, one obvious violation of the Emoluments Clause, just one example we can currently see given Turmp's paltry financial disclosure.) -- It can protect the clear will of the overwhelming majority, especially when faced with one-sided, last minute intelligence agency disclosures that measurably tilted the election. -- And it can, based on these narrow grounds (which pose little threat in the future and which are, in any event, part of the deal we made centuries ago), protect us against an undisciplined, unprincipled president-elect who has -- on many occasions since the election -- demonstrated his unfitness for the executive office.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":-0.5685,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":20,"json_serial_number":1052}]
