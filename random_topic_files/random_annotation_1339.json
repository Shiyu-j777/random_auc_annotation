Everyone knows what is healthy and what is not. Go to the grocery store and compare the price of healthy foods with unhealthy. Healthy is simply out of the price range of many people. Even if eating out to save time healthy is more expensive. Many are left with a choice. Do I stretch my dollar to get as many meals as possible or do I eat 1 healthy meal? There is also a possibility of a medical reason for some obesity. Despite what many want we do for in a one size fits all box. There is no \"\"\"\"standard\"\"\"\" size.

This Democratic Socialism is a federal government ideology. Police and fire is paid by local taxes, most roadway construction and maintenance is on a local level and state level. Federal highways receive federal money but state DOTs oversee the expenditure of capital. Medicaid is also state level. So to call all the services a form of Democratic Socialism is a bunch of malarky. If I could opt of of Social Security I would. If I could opt out of Medicare I would. I don't use USPS I use UPS or Fedex. Problem with supporters of Deoncratic Socialism here in this country is they don't even know what that term means. They dont know what Capitalism means either. They dont understand the greatest increase in the size of the middle class did not come from gvt spending and regulation, it came from a mich truer form of capitalism, not crony capitalism Lets have the majority by vote impose their ideology of collectivism over individualism on the minority and call it Democratic Socialism.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9873,"user_ideo":0.7089,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1339},{"user_id":10207902739541067,"comment_id":10154934615854614,"date":"2016-12-12","message":"Well yea him and all his crony billionaire filled cabinet, Exxon executive, and banks are all invested heavily in oil and oil production, with the world banks pumping out petro-dollars.
