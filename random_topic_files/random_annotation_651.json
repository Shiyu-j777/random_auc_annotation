And that's all I was really trying to ask. You and I both watched Clinton and Trump speeches without media bias and simply came to different conclusions. You and I both, as well as plenty of other Americans, put in the research to lead us to choose who we voted for as president. I was hoping for more actually related to his business and Trump News than Clinton coming up again. Trump is the president elect so I was wondering about him. Maybe you assume I'm tugging at some strings or something, but I was just looking for more on the business aspect.

We have real problems to deal with - like Homeland Security. Look what's happening in the world - ISIS is terrorizing every nation! Their racial issues are on them at this point. They haven't the facts to even back them up. They have blood on their hands! They should be arrested by the hundred at this point, not applauded or appeased. Here are some facts: An African-American Harvard Economist, Roland G. Frye, Jr., just published findings that there is no racial differences between the deadly shootings of whites and blacks by law enforcement in America. He began his study because he was angered by black men being shot by white cops. But his study surprisingly found that police officers use deadly force when they perceive a threat, regardless of skin color. This data undercuts the entire BLM's argument. He summarized by stating \"\"\"\"Yes, there are some instances of criminal acts, but they are far and in between,\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"they are not disproportionate by race.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9948,"user_ideo":0.7061,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":13},{"user_id":1083474601690534,"comment_id":10152928648811336,"date":"2015-01-28","message":"This is news?
