They try to avoid speaking to my husband and I in person. Over the phone as well and get mad because we show up frequently. Then they attempt to minimize the amount of time we speak.

I've had terrible haircuts because the stylist didn't have the knowledge to cut my funky asian hair and didn't inform me of that. Unfortunately not all salon schools or hair stylists learn to cut all types of hair. If she was being racist I'm sorry. Personally i wouldn't want to support her business because either she's racist or needs more training.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0298,"user_ideo":-0.6398,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":7},{"user_id":569967633202162,"comment_id":10154490913061509,"date":"2016-02-23","message":"Sofian you can afford this one","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0246,"user_ideo":-0.1287,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":8},{"user_id":10158065363990372,"comment_id":877206899005726,"date":"2015-01-30","message":"Yep this is just something extra she could do specifically for other families with a disabled member. That's no bad thing. If I was entitled to DLA for having a disabled son but earnt literally millions and millions of pounds I would donate it to families with more need than I. I actually have a disabled brother and DLA is very strict and they're constantly reviewing it, reducing the amount and trying to take away the help he needs. Therefore I can think of a few families who aren't mega rich who are probably in the same boat as my brother and struggling.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0688,"user_ideo":-0.1578,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":9},{"user_id":10207194628889242,"comment_id":10153165778178734,"date":"2015-03-10","message":"Stupid","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7772,"user_ideo":-0.7505,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":10},{"user_id":1380969185265549,"comment_id":10153175347314614,"date":"2015-03-09","message":"heartbreaking.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1428,"user_ideo":-0.3778,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":11},{"user_id":10206751175478297,"comment_id":895882910602285,"date":"2016-12-10","message":"shove a sock in it I am so tired of his big mouth that just continues to ruin MY COUNTRY, just resign now you stooge","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9478,"user_ideo":0.866,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":12},{"user_id":211927632620514,"comment_id":1346962175326569,"date":"2016-12-29","message":"We both lost our pops too early.
