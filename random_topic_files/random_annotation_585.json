There are some black people who won't be happy until all the white people are dead! I think white people are at the point where they are tired of going out of their way to prove they aren't racist and get told that they are.

Its at the point where they are asking for way too much from you to prove you are not racist and they will still never take no for an answer. I feel like black people need to start trying to understand what it is like being white, if they want to know if white people are racist or not!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7604,"user_ideo":0.3927,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":585},{"user_id":571874169683707,"comment_id":1333845563296154,"date":"2016-04-13","message":"Branson would be against any thing that limit where He can trade.
