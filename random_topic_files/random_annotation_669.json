The verse you quoted about quran saying to kill an innocent is as if one killed the whole world is not quoted in its full context nor did you dare post the verse which follows immediately after it.

If you cannot do this then you are defending the wrongdoing.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6053,"user_ideo":0.4979,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":121,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":669},{"user_id":10154862575624680,"comment_id":1197268513629528,"date":"2016-07-24","message":"Thank you Leo.
