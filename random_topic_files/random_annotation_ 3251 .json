If not go back to school and learn what words mean because darling you just misinterpreted what I said all the down the line. I do not support criminals and I do not support cops being brutal and I sure as hell do not support people trying to make good cops look bad,and I do not support arguing over bs and arguing over something someone read all wrong.
