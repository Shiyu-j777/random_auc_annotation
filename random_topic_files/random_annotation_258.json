Because some are more severe than others. How about our LEO's and military that suffer from PTSD/depression? Do the permit holders get grandfathered in or do they have to be evaluated now? Or do their medical records just get looked at? Which then lead to the question of how many people would NOT talk to their doctor because rights would be withheld. There are already too many folks who aren't willing to fill out forms we have because \"\"\"\"the governments gonna watch them\"\"\"\". Who's going to check the medical records, Government or private companies? Will hippa laws have to be rewritten? I'm all for gun control, but this mental health issue is too big to resolve.
