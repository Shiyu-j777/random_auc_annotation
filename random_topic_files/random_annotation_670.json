Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":10},{"user_id":1261178803892640,"comment_id":983228285067650,"date":"2015-07-04","message":"That is me after driving 10 hours....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2797,"user_ideo":0.7224,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":11},{"user_id":10210519455484636,"comment_id":1018664681500617,"date":"2015-07-31","message":"Yep!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.55,"user_ideo":0.5795,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":12},{"user_id":10211000981924576,"comment_id":10153409484406973,"date":"2016-01-17","message":"Funny thing is, the FBI did not put up those cameras.

Aside from pre-Reagan crap that went down...some of the things he did were terrible. Iran-Contra? So what about Pres. BUSH Sitting like a DOPE and doing nothing for 9 min after twin towers hit.

Blackwater and NOLA The fact that Pres. Bush and Dick Chenney committed war crimes and also crimes against humanity by lying about the reasons for war. Maybe Democrats should remember the next time the GOP do something that is really reckless like ignore warnings and intell regarding an eminent terrorist attack given by the outgoing administration .
