I do because it was the first time in 40 years I had ever been called a Racist. Yet when Carson ran the Democrats were nowhere to be found nor was the charge of Racism. Obama personally lowered himself and his office to get involved in 3 local level situations where the supposed victim was Black and the supposed perpetrator was not Black. In the second two such situations the President of the United States inserted a charge of Racism. In the case of Martin-Zimmerman the situation had already been investigated by the State of Florida and the FBI and neither found any Civil Rights violations. Yet Obama and the Democrats inserted Racism into a situation where it had already been proven not to be, initiated another investigation by the Obama-Holder DOJ which again found nothing. It didn't matter. Obama and the Democrats had worked their intent and it took hold causing widespread protests and riots based on lies. Then Obama and the Democrats inserted Racism into the Brown-Wilson case in Ferguson nearly before the smoke had cleared. The State of Missouri did an investigation and the Obama-Holder DOJ did an investigation and suprise, surprise NO Racism involved! Yet Ferguson was nearly burnt to the ground, BLM was created based on a lie and a complete thug who wasn't smart enough not to attack an armed police officer is now treated as a folk hero. Since Ferguson and the intentional acts of Obama, the Democrats and the lapdog media, businesses have been looted and burned, innocent people and LEO's have been attacked and murdered and people with immediate access to the truth are spouting lies just like you did here. Racism has been used by and from the Left since 2007 and it has literally cost people their livelihoods and lives. You can obviously excuse anything, including murder, committed by the POLITICAL PARTY you have chosen to leash yourself to while regurgitating pet food. I'm told, by Democrats, that since I'm white I owe blacks for Slavery, even though I have never owned slaves, never knew anyone who owned slaves and all former slaves were dead decades before I was born. My response has been that not only do I not owe anyone for anything I nor they were part of, I will not be charged with paying for what most of an entire race suffered a century before I was born that they have now spent half a century fighting to suffer again under the same people and party.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.4551,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":236,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":316},{"user_id":2062703773954823,"comment_id":10154263190692452,"date":"2017-02-17","message":"That's our San Clemente Man!!
