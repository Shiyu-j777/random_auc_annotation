But he didn't do too bad considering he went the distance . He will and should drop back to his belt weight defend his belt for couple of fights & move up one weight see how that takes him. In time gain the heavy weight skills needed to beat the weight he just narrowly lost out to . Strength of man was honestly more pride in the irish to witness what should always be honour in loosing with head held high . Still a legend and he gain even more fans when he gets back to his own circuit , that fight last night will make him focus more on the sport and less of showman ship.

The government should be providing for the people only what the free market cannot provide for them, medicine being one of those things, and so I would like to reduce social and entitlement spending we are doing so he is feasible and actually cost efficient. Often cutting government funding costs far more maintaining current levels. The government in my opinion only has two real responsibilities, protecting the people so they can pursue the advancement of our society, and directly funding scientific and technological research. I think we have an in balance of those two responsibilities, with the first being funded far too much and the second far too little. I have a dinner obligation right now and have to go, but I would like to continue this conversation at some point because, although you have made a few reductionist arguments, this has been interesting.
