They were all approved by the justice, the process was running in secret to avoid interference, but once Lula was nominated minister, government manoeuvre to avoid his prosecution, The judge, through legal means, declared the process as public And legally exposed all evidence.

And you are also wrong about Brazilians, all we want is all corrupted people to pay for their crimes.

However, not all apples are equal. Sure would be nice to know the carrots came from land that wasn't full of residual pesticides. That the burgers weren't pink slime, that the lettuce hadn't been sprayed with poison and the milk was actually healthy. I don't think vending machines belong in public schools, but if they are water and both chewy and crunchy nutrition bars should be the only options. That should be a district choice though.

This is such a misleading article. I'm not even into games, but find this highly offensive from an accurate truth point of view. I do hope the title is meant to be read as a sign of hope, people pay that money because they probably want to see the game be made. How can you expect a fully functional game of that size before putting in considerable amounts of money? Just think of the latest GTA with a 1/4 of a billion funding.
