Gaza is 'governed' by terrorist organisation Hamas whose charter actively calls for the destruction of Israel and every man, woman and child there. The West Bank is run by Fatah, who also indiscriminately murder all opposition and plot jihad while state TV incites hatred of Israelis and glorify terrorist killers by naming public squares after them. Israel has repeatedly offered 94% of the land to Palestinian leaders for their independent country with the other 6% in land swaps but no leader accepts any deal because they don't want a two state solution! they want to continue stealing the aid money (Palestinians get more aid money per capita than anyone on earth) and preaching violence and victimisation. None of them have any will to actually run a country. And they know that if they were president of just another failed, backward, corrupt, illiterate Arab country they'd fade into oblivian, no more undeserved photo ops at the front of the Paris march and at the White House.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6877,"user_ideo":0.2088,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":865},{"user_id":618570868297630,"comment_id":1071704419592476,"date":"2015-12-17","message":"Surprise surprise surprise.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4387,"user_ideo":-0.6596,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":865},{"user_id":10207916922574215,"comment_id":10155576276306509,"date":"2016-11-08","message":"How are Hillary fand Trolls?Trump trolls may now leave the chat!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0184,"user_ideo":-0.1252,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":865},{"user_id":10206927116678164,"comment_id":10154965528294411,"date":"2016-12-06","message":"What are they trying to convert them into?
