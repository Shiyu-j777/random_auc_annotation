I voted for religious freedom. I voted for the Constitution. I voted to drain the swamp. I voted for term limits. I voted to bust up government corruption. I voted for all those who get judged and written off for their past sins. I voted for the good husbands, fathers, loving grandfathers, and patriots who used to be crass youths with rotten judgment. I voted for the farmers and small business owners. I voted for those victimized by Obamacare's punitive costs. I voted for lower taxes. I voted to repeal the Johnson Amendment. I voted for better trade deals. I voted for Supreme Court justices who aren't leftist activists. I voted for jobs. I voted for the non-politician. I voted to banish political correctness.

Better yet-the Marines should look at the training methodology and gear issued to those Marines and make sure those women truly had a fair chance. I'm concerned the Marines will release the results before examining how these tests were conducted. At the end of the day-the service does have to find a way to reflect the society it serves.
