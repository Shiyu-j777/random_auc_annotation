They have an extraordinary record of wasting billions on a project that won't get used. I am disgusted with the whole bunch of them. They are being paid to enable projects like these. While it may be faster and unmanned, I seriously doubt if it's cheaper than anything else we're making. Bottom line is that we should NOT be making more war machines; we need to turn our attention toward the making of peaceful countries. War is not anachronous and threatens all of humanity and the future of the world. Having peace would save ALL countries a bundle. We need a Department of Peace that will put clamps on these criminal runaway budgets for more war toys. Someone needs to step and be an adult and tell the children to quit fighting. Bernie might just be that adult.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0009,"user_ideo":-0.7099,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1255},{"user_id":10209177984821171,"comment_id":10153150945651756,"date":"2015-01-07","message":"I see, Patty, so you believe that we must bow down to the jihadists.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.751,"user_ideo":-0.4921,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1255},{"user_id":1253088918059324,"comment_id":10154096684778812,"date":"2016-02-05","message":"Don't care","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.76,"user_ideo":0.4675,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1255},{"user_id":10207183777977231,"comment_id":10153128647113445,"date":"2015-06-15","message":"If someone needs to tell you when to smoke, you just need a kit kat bar ...

The local mill had been on strike for months and many of our men had left for jobs in other places, leaving their families behind to tend the home fires. Few of us had anything extra for gift giving and it was all we could do to make sure that our children did not feel the pinch too badly. We decided to forego the regular extended family gift exchange and instead we set a limit of no more than 1$ per gift, throwing out a challenge for who could find the most creative gift for that amount. It was the most fun and heartfelt Christmas I can remember as we came up with gag gifts, certificates promising our time or offering something special for the recipient. It made a very bleak time just a little brighter and the gifts and laughter exchanged that year were filled with more love than any expensive alternative could possibly have provided.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1786,"user_ideo":-0.4647,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1255},{"user_id":10208203952834242,"comment_id":10153742589069091,"date":"2016-05-24","message":"Y r u zooming on clouds tf","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0567,"user_ideo":-0.359,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":1255},{"user_id":10153622082041230,"comment_id":10154082944514445,"date":"2016-03-21","message":"ridiculous...we are raising such a generation of babies!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7353,"user_ideo":-0.4061,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1255},{"user_id":1239991946020314,"comment_id":10153684546037016,"date":"2016-09-01","message":"solidarity from ireland x","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0014,"user_ideo":-0.9253,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1255},{"user_id":1757280987847003,"comment_id":10152752096166051,"date":"2015-01-26","message":"She's not from America she's in England.
