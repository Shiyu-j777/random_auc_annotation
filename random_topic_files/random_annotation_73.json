Sure beats what anyone else will tell you on the Internet. Honestly, I'm a Christian but want nothing but peace for everyone. We can all coexist, but we are all too stubborn in our own ways. So go get yourself a Bible and a Quran and read up. You will find that in most religions the first testament is the foundation for them. I encourage all of you to educate YOURSELVES and learn from the positive values it will teach. I don't care who your are what color, race, religion, gender, etc. I'll will give you each the individual respect humans deserve, only the actions you take on me or what you do to others will change that.
