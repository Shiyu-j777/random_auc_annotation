Refugee Abu Hasan al-Idlibi told Zaman al-Wasl the Lebanese army will bulldoze every camp which does not evacuate. Idlibi who resides in Naser al-Zareqa camp confirmed that Lebanese army personnel arrested 20 refugee young men by raiding the camp under pretext of refugees owning motorcycles. He mentioned the Lebanese officer warned orally during the raid the residents in the camps in the town to start deportation during two days without locating any alternative land to build their camps or where they can relocate to. A local source told Zaman al-Wasl the camps which started evacuating are Udai Hilal camp, Mohamed Abu Hasan camp, Nasal al-Qaydi camp, Mohamed Abbas camp, Hatem Dawlat al-Abed Satar camp, Abu Khaled al-Jamal camp, and al-Makhaseem camp. Residents from Khaled Alam al-Din camp, where families from Hama and Homs live in al-Manya town, said the Lebanese officer told them not to establish any camps in the area extended from Tripoli to the Syrian borders.'","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.04,"user_ideo":-0.5988,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":19,"json_serial_number":715},{"user_id":10155138405047846,"comment_id":10153489009690090,"date":"2015-09-03","message":"I would say she is more middle of the road.
