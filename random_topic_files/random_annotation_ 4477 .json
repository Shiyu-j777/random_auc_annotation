You're completely right that bills can wait, however I don't put myself in financial situations. I'd rather use my degree, that I paid for & help sick people get better. What if someone was going into labor? What if someone was rushing to the hospital to spend the last minutes their loved ones have on earth? What if an ambulance got stuck in that traffic? What if a cop was trying to get to a call and stop a robbery?

Your argument is that because there is no direct democracy, a totalitarian dictatorship is a better choice? Again why are you here? In these capitalist evil world we are living in. There is a better one, you just need to buy a ticket, the good state of NK will take care of the rest. Just go to the custom office and say you hate America and the western capitalist pigs and you are set.
