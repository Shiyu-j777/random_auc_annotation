As much as they argue and fight about it, the Quaran has passages that are written in present tense, and that are open to interpretation. Due to this fact, unhappy zealots use the scripture and are guided by 'scholars' that lead these unhappy individuals into violent acts. This is a FACT. One can argue all day about which relogion, ideology, or group is worst of all time, but TODAY, Islam is the scapegoat, because Islam has EARNED that title. And instead of Muslims APOLOGIZING for the heinous acts of their and understanding WHY they are being targeted, MUSLIMS instead choose to argue and justify their religion. This is why people are angry and this is why it will only get worse. Here is a question I pose: who did more for Civil Rights in this country, MLK or Malcom X?
