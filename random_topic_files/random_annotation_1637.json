I had an amnio in 1989. If something had been wrong, I would have terminated the pregnancy. I did not want my older 2 kids to have to perhaps eventually have to take care of a child with disabilities because Mom decided to wear a \"\"\"\"badge of honor\"\"\"\". Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so. That decision to have your child is yours, just like it was her decision to terminate. Her decision did not affect you in any way, so why make it personal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0696,"user_ideo":0.6275,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":3},{"user_id":1231467710196830,"comment_id":834833069888477,"date":"2015-02-23","message":"Pure oatmeal...not sugared one","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2063,"user_ideo":-0.757,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":4},{"user_id":834732773327902,"comment_id":502365603287353,"date":"2015-03-08","message":"Please God, NO!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5913,"user_ideo":0.8768,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":5},{"user_id":1170918929616375,"comment_id":10153662084833812,"date":"2015-08-07","message":"of course. that's a great choice.
