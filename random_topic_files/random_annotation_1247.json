Hundreds of GTA Muslim men in polygamous marriages -- some with a harem of wives -- are receiving welfare and social benefits for each of their spouses, thanks to the city and province, Muslim leaders say. Mumtaz Ali, president of the Canadian Society of Muslims, said wives in polygamous marriages are recognized as spouses under the Ontario Family Law Act, providing they were legally married under Muslim laws abroad. \"\"\"\"Polygamy is a regular part of life for many Muslims,\"\"\"\" Ali said yesterday. \"\"\"\"Ontario recognizes religious marriages for Muslims and others.\"\"\"\" He estimates \"\"\"\"several hundred\"\"\"\" GTA husbands in polygamous marriages are receiving benefits. Under Islamic law, a Muslim man is permitted to have up to four spouses.In a memo to the city, officials were notified it could cost an estimated $150,000 to $200,000 per week for food, shelter and transportation for two weeks or as long as it takes to provide permanent housing.Those estimates are based on the cost of housing evacuees during forest fires in the far North this past summer.
