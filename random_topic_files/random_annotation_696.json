Bush limited public access to presidential records. The order, No. 13233, was issued by Mr. Bush in 2001. It expanded the power of current and former chief executives â€” and their heirs â€” to restrict access to their official records. Last year the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation that would have gutted the order, but the measure ran into resistance in the Senate. The House took up the issue again this month.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0374,"user_ideo":0.4536,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":140,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":696},{"user_id":1815756885365995,"comment_id":10152943663404641,"date":"2015-01-08","message":"Unfortunately we cannot ban religion, but what we can ban is guns and atomic bombs to help stop wars from building up.
