They aren't seeking attention, nor are they \"\"\"\"encouraging harmful behavior in their child.\"\"\"\" Far from it--they are bravely accepting her for who she is. The article is about the release of the documentary and the story Coy's family was bold and gracious enough to share at the time. They made the documentary to help and encourage other families and children like Coy, and since then they have deliberately stepped back from the public eye. They declined to be interviewed for the article and are living out of the spotlight in order to pursue a normal life for their family. If they were 'seeking attention,' they wouldn't have declined an interview.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0069,"user_ideo":-0.6883,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":425},{"user_id":1312909502060079,"comment_id":10154931802788812,"date":"2016-10-23","message":"Vote For Trump","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9985,"user_ideo":0.2991,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":425},{"user_id":1297865663607677,"comment_id":10152883198361135,"date":"2015-06-29","message":"You got it, lock n load people","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9979,"user_ideo":0.1277,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":425},{"user_id":1487190824639648,"comment_id":10153445354739342,"date":"2015-10-31","message":",,, just don't give..its that simple..they are not going to force you to give are they?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7409,"user_ideo":0.3706,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":95,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":425},{"user_id":1573331269637149,"comment_id":10154186861241509,"date":"2015-11-01","message":"lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3373,"user_ideo":-0.2901,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":95,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":425},{"user_id":10153761036606161,"comment_id":10153264696579877,"date":"2015-08-12","message":"this made me truly lmao","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0442,"user_ideo":-0.5139,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":425},{"user_id":1602114850085903,"comment_id":863017717222138,"date":"2016-10-12","message":", and Fox News are fake republican propaganda sites.
