Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine took advantage of the state's lax gift laws to receive an $18,000 Caribbean vacation, $5,500 in clothes and a trip to watch George Mason University play in the NCAA basketball Final Four during his years as lieutenant governor and governor, according to disclosures he filed. Now a leading contender to be Hillary Clinton's running mate, Kaine reported more than $160,000 in gifts from 2001 to 2009, mostly for travel to and from political events and conferences, according to disclosures compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project. The givers included political supporters, a drug company that soon after bought a facility in Virginia, and Dominion, the state's biggest provider of electricity. While legal under Virginia's unusually permissive ethics rules, the gifts could become attack-ad fodder after similar presents led to corruption charges for Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose conviction the Supreme Court overturned Monday. Republicans could also use the records to portray Kaine as part of the self-dealing establishment in a cycle animated by hostility toward the political class.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4089,"user_ideo":0.313,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":434},{"user_id":943051032462353,"comment_id":10152795282848445,"date":"2015-01-24","message":"Niga lets go im down i got a car to go cali","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0499,"user_ideo":0.0517,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":225,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":434},{"user_id":10154373331958373,"comment_id":10153851476909197,"date":"2016-01-25","message":"I'd like to watch Manning win the super bowl","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7324,"user_ideo":-0.1285,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":434},{"user_id":1060107127407786,"comment_id":1045686462191868,"date":"2016-07-03","message":"He put that cigar WHERE?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6625,"user_ideo":0.7659,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":434},{"user_id":10211845504959249,"comment_id":10154125692591051,"date":"2016-10-05","message":"Secretary of State knows damn well what information is top secret and what isn't she thinks we are stupid!!
