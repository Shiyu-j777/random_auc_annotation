I've had terrible haircuts because the stylist didn't have the knowledge to cut my funky asian hair and didn't inform me of that. Unfortunately not all salon schools or hair stylists learn to cut all types of hair. If she was being racist I'm sorry. Personally i wouldn't want to support her business because either she's racist or needs more training.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0298,"user_ideo":-0.6398,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":6},{"user_id":1096050823826054,"comment_id":10154279845597014,"date":"2017-02-23","message":"Explain how they started it.
