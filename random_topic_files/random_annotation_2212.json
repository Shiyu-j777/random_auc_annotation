I went years with a sleep disorder and eventually went to a neurologist because I thought was having signs of dementia or something because my memory was horrible. After testing and MRI to rule out other possibilities she suggested I get my stress and sleep problems under control.After trying several things that had bad side effects and left me feeling like a zombie someone suggested essential oils. Bingo! It didn't happen overnight but over the next couple months of trying different combinations my sleep cycle corrected itself. It had made a world of difference in my mind functioning. I don't think people realize how much long term sleep issues can impact your brain. Sorry about the long story but thought it's something really important to think about.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0426,"user_ideo":-0.4018,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":10},{"user_id":1137173099674298,"comment_id":10153307302514087,"date":"2015-11-04","message":"Of course NBC used a Republican and a dizzy woman","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0664,"user_ideo":-0.3974,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":11},{"user_id":10101231967948182,"comment_id":10153666115229060,"date":"2015-10-09","message":"The US did not lose the Korean War; it ended in a stalemate.
