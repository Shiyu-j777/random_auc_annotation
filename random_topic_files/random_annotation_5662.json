I donâ€t think they have. Iâ€ve read that emails have a signature that can be compared with the original to see if they have been altered. All those emails from all those people and Iâ€m sure many more, show we were nation building. By nation building we mean globalist, an unelected one-world-government. Obama UN transcript Sept 20, 2016 â€œToday, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.â€ â€œSo just as I've pursued these measures here at home, so has the United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism -- not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it.â€ In Hillaryâ€s leaked emails she gave a speech saying â€œMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open marketsâ€ . â€œMy dream is a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders, sometime in the future with energy that is as green and sustainable as we can get it, powering growth and opportunity for every person in the hemisphereâ€ . â€œWe have to resist protectionism, other kinds of barriers to market access and to tradeâ€ . Bill Clinton in a 2003 speech called for the establishment of a â€œglobal community,â€ â€œopenness of our borders to immigrants,â€ America â€œhas great obligations to open our borders.â€ He believes the formation of a â€œgenuine global communityâ€ complete with and â€œover-arching systemâ€ to regulate it, to be â€œthe great mission of the 21st century.â€ We killed nearly 600,000 people in the Mid-East and Africa, destroyed their infrastructure, made millions of refugees and forever changed the demographics of Europe and some cities in the U.S. We killed Gaddafi to protect France from Libyaâ€s gold backed currency. Itâ€s in Wikileaks. We got rid of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to install the Muslim Brotherhood Mohamed Morsi that taught at California State University Northridge. Whose wife was friends with Hillary Clintonâ€s girlfriend, Huma Abedinâ€s mom in the Muslim Sisterhood and had ties to President Obamaâ€s closest confidant, Valarie Jarrett who said: â€œI am Iranian by birth and of my Islamic Faith. I am also an American citizen and seek to help change America to be a more Islamic country. My faith guides me and I feel like it is going well in the transition of using freedom of religion in America against itselfâ€ - Valerie Jarrett Stanford University 1977. They wanted to overthrow Syria because their President Assad was a moderate. Assad wears a suit and his wife is from the U.K., she does not wear any mask or head covering. They and their government were Alawites. We were lied to for weeks of NBC reporting about the White Helmets. Netflix's 'White Helmets' Highlights a Syrian Rescue Group on the Front Line Volunteers by day, terrorists by night: The double life of White Helmets SOTT ^ | 29 September 2016 Iâ€ve got plenty of links, but this was the most convincing. We were fighting in Syria against their President Assad. Russia was fighting to protect Assad. Russia was killing ISIS and when they were done, Aleppo was free. When Russia and Syria were done, all of Syria partied in the streets waiving posters of their president and their flags. Hillary, Obama and Kerry were in mourning. Now all those people in the first paragraph are sulking, blaming Russia for a Trump win when all we got from Wikilinks was the truth. Wikilinks showed us that the way these people created regime change was through social media, fomenting hatred, riots, and civil war using professional agitators. People that make a living at it. Those same people are here in America planning on using useless idiots to riot in the streets, rich women with pussy hats on their heads, people uncomfortable with the color of their skin, illegal aliens, women that want to kill their children, communists, socialists, freeloaders, celebrities, gender challenged, buttercups, Hillary losers and Bernie losers. The guy that wants to put in 8 hours of work, go home to his loving wife and then go out to play with the kids will win.
