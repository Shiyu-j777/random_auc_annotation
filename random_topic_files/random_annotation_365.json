Most of the women were subject to Trump's authority/power and didn't feel that they could speak up. Once he lied on television about \"\"\"\"never\"\"\"\" having inappropriately kissed or grabbed any woman, they came forward to set the record straight. Jill Harth was a businesswoman who was in the middle of a huge deal with Trump and couldn't afford to blow it. Temple Taggart was a young contestant in the pageant that he owned. Rachel Crooks was a receptionist at Trump Tower. Natasha Stoynoff was a reporter for People who was assigned to the Trump beat. He had the power to financially/otherwise ruin any of these women. They were weak and he had authority. That's how he chooses his victims and why he thinks he can get away with it.
