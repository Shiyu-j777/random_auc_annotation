In Washington, D.C., however, the big story isnâ€t on the main stage.

The investigation announcement came over the weekend in response to conservative lawmakerâ€s charges of public corruption. Thatâ€s according to a report by The Daily Callerâ€s Richard Pollock, which first reported on the July 22nd IRS letter that acknowledged the tax agency had officially â€œforwarded the information to our Exempt Organizations Examination programâ€ which â€œconsiders all referralsâ€ from the IRS chief.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9913,"user_ideo":0.6432,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":182},{"user_id":778582178945367,"comment_id":1011734322180257,"date":"2015-10-04","message":"14 guns and no one spoke up about his mental health issues?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0889,"user_ideo":0.263,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":182},{"user_id":1331922710168790,"comment_id":10153565243286320,"date":"2015-07-09","message":"Why!!
