There are quite a few items on that list I could put down that Mr. Trump has presented to us in the last year during the campaign. I don't see one item on your list of Ms. Clinton's that is recent. Mr. Trump is a racist bigot who demeans women, those that are disabled, those of different sexual orientations, people of color and those of different religions, which is exactly the backbone of this country. If he doesn't get his way, he pouts and blames every one else. I am sorry that is not the kind of leader I want for my country.

The investigation that Faherenthold launched into the Trump Foundation, along with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€s personal finances, has unearthed the fact that Donald Trump has used his charitable foundation, which is tax-exempt, as a tool to evade $2.3 million dollars of personal income taxes. How? By having business associates that owe him money to put it into his foundation instead. An excellent example is that the Trump Foundation took in payments â€œtotaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.â€ According to sources in the Trump organization who wish to remain anonymous the man is Richard Ebers, and he was told that instead of paying the former reality TV star for services, he should pay the Trump Foundation instead. It makes sense really, when you consider the fact that despite the reality that Donald Trump hasnâ€t even bothered donating to his own foundation since 2008 the â€œdonationsâ€ continue to pour in. One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€s senior advisers, Boris Epshteyn, actually tried to explain it away by saying: â€˜What Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely â€œsuggestâ€ that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.â€","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.016,"user_ideo":-0.7941,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":23},{"user_id":925642077561676,"comment_id":1780615422171689,"date":"2016-06-10","message":"\"\"\"\"Underappreciated\"\"\"\" is an understatement!
