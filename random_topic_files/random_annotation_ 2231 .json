I do tend to look at people oddly when they drink cow's milk because I think it's disgusting. For those who don't look at others oddly when they drink cow's milk, their reasonings are likely because when we drink cow's milk, it's usually out of a cup, which comes from a carton/jug/bag. We don't generally see grown humans hanging off of a cow's udder when they want a drink. That would be weird.. and we would look at them oddly.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0205,"user_ideo":-0.5775,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":8},{"user_id":10207925460988582,"comment_id":10153945930186179,"date":"2016-10-17","message":"You are simply gullible, hate-dilled, and lying.

These three overlap each other greatly to the extent of almost being indistinguishable from each other.
