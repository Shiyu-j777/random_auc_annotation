All poverty students which is typically 70% of a school get TO EAT WHATEVER THEY WANT!!! I don't think any of you understand the lunch program. You feel sorry for the kid who had to eat a cheese sandwich (which the parent had to pay for it), but you've no idea what the underlying issue is. Why do poverty students get a free lunch while the rich students don't?!?? Everything else is paid for by the school district. And, I, mean everything else. Do you know why the federal government pays (with a contract) for free, reduced lunch, yet the rich students have to pay full price????? The rich students have to pay more to make up for the difference that the federal government doesn't pay for the poverty/reduced lunches!!!! This is what you should be outraged about, but no, you're little sheeple, who just follow along because the big, bad wolf is lurking in the woods and you're afraid of him. So, you pretend like you're all over the issue by getting mad at the parents who didn't pay up the bill. You should be mad at the federal government. I can't fight this issue, alone, people need to become aware of the real issue and start the movement with me. EVERY CHILD SHOULD RECEIVE A FREE LUNCH when they are a student at a federally funded school, regardless if the funds are federally released, released by grants, scholarships and/or other avenues of \"\"\"\"federal\"\"\"\" funding which is the TAX PAYERS MONEY. Federal money is NOT what the government makes or earns...it is what YOU make and pay into!!!
