She was also paid for speeches, appearances and some consulting when she was not holding office. She also earned money on her previously invested income. Her political position has certainly helped her earnings as it has with other politicians. Most members of congress are millionaires and many leave to go to work for the very industries they often encountered as members of congress. Hillary hasn't done anything illegal or unethical under current standards. That said, I would like to see all money removed from politics and all members of government forced to live like the average constituents in their districts. Maybe then they would pass legislation that addresses problems that we all deal with on a daily basis.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"user_ideo":-0.7547,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":304},{"user_id":10154010651208999,"comment_id":10155197973549155,"date":"2017-02-25","message":"Ignored","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.439,"user_ideo":0.556,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":304},{"user_id":10153674511140919,"comment_id":10154723826024228,"date":"2016-11-01","message":"Confuse, support, and raise awareness all at once.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.074,"user_ideo":-0.4526,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":304},{"user_id":10153990179072991,"comment_id":10153673687474411,"date":"2015-08-30","message":"Im not American, and this has nothing to do with Iraq, typical 'ard response, try and mention something the US has done to disrupt the conversation.
