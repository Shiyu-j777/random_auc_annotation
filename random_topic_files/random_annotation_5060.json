Aside from pre-Reagan crap that went down...some of the things he did were terrible. Iran-Contra? So what about Pres. BUSH Sitting like a DOPE and doing nothing for 9 min after twin towers hit. Iraq War fiasco and feeding false info and Intel to ALL Abu-Graib Halliburton FEMA and Hurricane Catrina And Pres. Bush waiting 4 days to send ships to NOLA after. Blackwater and NOLA The fact that Pres. Bush and Dick Chenney committed war crimes and also crimes against humanity by lying about the reasons for war. Maybe Democrats should remember the next time the GOP do something that is really reckless like ignore warnings and intell regarding an eminent terrorist attack given by the outgoing administration .

I do tend to look at people oddly when they drink cow's milk because I think it's disgusting. For those who don't look at others oddly when they drink cow's milk, their reasonings are likely because when we drink cow's milk, it's usually out of a cup, which comes from a carton/jug/bag. We don't generally see grown humans hanging off of a cow's udder when they want a drink. That would be weird.. and we would look at them oddly.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0205,"user_ideo":-0.5775,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":17},{"user_id":10207932555445442,"comment_id":1089086994447488,"date":"2016-03-10","message":"That's kinda pathetic.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3078,"user_ideo":-0.5712,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":18},{"user_id":10209032518562621,"comment_id":1140962939255049,"date":"2015-11-25","message":"Why is this not halted?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6076,"user_ideo":-0.7138,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":19},{"user_id":1134482123279944,"comment_id":10154427310758271,"date":"2016-12-26","message":"Yeah may have to make a 7-11 run...already been to Walgreens...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5142,"user_ideo":-0.0036,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":20}]
