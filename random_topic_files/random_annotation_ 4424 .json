The second you start demonising food and putting the \"\"\"\"the more you eat the fatter you'll get\"\"\"\" label on it, the more eating disorders you'll come across and the less healthy people will be. The public don't know how to lose weight properly, most of them will just starve themselves. Assuming this plan works.. People won't be eating well, they'll be eating less and worse. A good diet includes a bit of everything including small doses of sugar, fat and of course, plenty of VARIETY. This is essential to keep everything functioning. Even taking multivitamins in the morning and walking a dog or something on a regular basis can make all the difference in the world to your health. Which will of course have a positive impact on your weight. Another thing is parenting. I know too many kids that won't eat a wide range of certain foods because they 'don't like it', 'it looks gross' or 'the texture makes me gag'. People that let their children substitute water with squash are also risking their child's health. Paracetamol won't fix everything but pain and too many children use it for the wrong reason. Letting your child eat junk food while ill is also idiotic. That needs a big change. You need to be raised into these good habits or very motivated to adopt them. Not everybody is. That's the problem.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0096,"user_ideo":-0.404,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":17},{"user_id":10211379692382291,"comment_id":10153673055232756,"date":"2016-05-16","message":"Why advertise how much the ring is worth whom ever took it is sure as heck not going to bring it back now.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7846,"user_ideo":-0.0359,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":18},{"user_id":10208827143387565,"comment_id":10154538201083645,"date":"2017-01-30","message":"RIP, was a fun game at the time....","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5892,"user_ideo":-0.0925,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":19},{"user_id":1496915573667184,"comment_id":10153387904264087,"date":"2015-12-15","message":"Corker must have the same accountant that they use over at the Clinton Foundation.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9762,"user_ideo":0.7949,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":20}]
