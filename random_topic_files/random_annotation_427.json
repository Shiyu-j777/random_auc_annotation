What is more important, being diplomatic or standing by and watching these countries behead our citizens with a steak knife? What is more important, your \"\"\"\"relationship\"\"\"\" with these countries or allowing them to burn our flag, rape our citizens, kidnap and torture American's? Is it being diplomatic to allow terrorist groups into this country by the millions and give them ample opportunity for a repeat of 911? I guess the most diplomatic part would be letting our veterans, elderly and poor starve and be denied the health care they so desperately need and instead give it to illegal immigrants? Which do you think is more diplomatic? Personally, I do not think ANY of them are qualified to do the job, but I am ready for someone who is tired of the bullshit we have lived with for so long to end! He owes nobody because nobody owns him or has invested in his candidacy. He does not care whose feelings are hurt or who gets offended. He is out for the American people and this country first! A trait that many of our fore fathers shared with him when this country was strong and feared by other nations! We need to be in that position again. We need someone who will tell them to take their oil and shove it up their asses and try to eat sand for dinner! The price will come down if the food stops leaving this country and headed in their direction. It is time for good old fashion leadership gets back in the white house!

In clubs, stores, you name it. I don't live my life filled with fear and hate. Now if anyone tried to share a stall with me, I'd have a problem. Having them in there looking in the mirror, using a toilet, or washing their hands doesn't bother me at all. How do you expect a person who has changed their physical appearance, a person with breasts and in all appearances is a female, to go into the men's room? Straight men might be more uncomfortable with that and are more prone to assault a trans women than women are. Gay/trans people don't want to hurt or rape your kids. You people need to separate pedophiles from LGBT people. They are not one and the same. My husband likes woman, that doesn't mean he's attracted to little girls too. I like grown men that doesn't mean I'm attracted to little boys. The same goes for LGBT people. Pedophiles are sick and disgusting creatures. They enjoy the suffering and torment of innocent children. They normally lead heterosexual lives.
