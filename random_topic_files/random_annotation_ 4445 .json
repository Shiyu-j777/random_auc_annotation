Unlike Zimbabwe or some other corrupt African governments, the U.S. Federal Election Commission has conducted the Presidential election in a perfect, scientific and systematic manner without any corrupt practice. \"\"\"\"To be clear: The equipment that people vote on is NOT connected to the Internet,\"\"\"\" the National Association of Secretaries of State wrote in an open letter to Congress. \"\"\"\"Vote counting is NEVER done with systems connected to the Internet, and tabulation systems are not networked.\"\"\"\" In sum, Russia has not hacked votes and therefore CIA is bluffing to fool the public. CIA AND OBAMA CIA chief Brennan is a Muslim. He opted to take the oath on a copy of the U.S. Constitution, not on the Bible as every past CIA director, Christian and Jewish, had done. Both Obama and Brennan were shocked by the unexpected victory of Trump and they have now planned to attribute Trump's victory to Russian hacking. The New York Times commented that ¡°in the 67 years since the C.I.A. was founded, few presidents have had as close a bond with their intelligence chiefs as Mr. Obama has forged with Mr. Brennan.
