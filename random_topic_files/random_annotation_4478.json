Over the progress of the impeachment trial,two episodes can define actually what is going on. First episode, one audio record was leaked involving 3 head senators (one of them was involved in Slavery accusation, that was archived later of course). They literally talked about rise up Temer as president, so would be more easily to put breaks on the Lava Jato operation (op that unleashed all the political crisis in the country). This week, days before the senate trial, there was another leak in the investigations, pointing one of the Minister of Supreme Court as another beneficiary from the Petrobras corruption scheme. Summing up, what is happening on Brasil is criminals fighting criminals for power. The Mainstream media keeps moving people around the two main groups: The 'Fora Dilma' supporters and the 'Fora Temer' supporters. Brasil Politics are shit, just like anywhere on the planet. The difference is that we now have a circus to watch.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0348,"user_ideo":-0.4756,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":8},{"user_id":10206696687336153,"comment_id":681859278671317,"date":"2015-10-25","message":"Her face needs to be on toilet paper","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9932,"user_ideo":0.4571,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":9},{"user_id":10154427541519645,"comment_id":10154218843191756,"date":"2016-03-08","message":"is libertarian???
