The Colombians are in mixed emotions due to the so called (human mistake or error) by Steve Harvey. While at the back stage, in a conference room, in a corner or in a limousine the way I picture it- Mr. Steve Harvey may have been annoyed, contemplating, and wondering how in the world he made such a big mistake. Or may be discouraged by what happened at the stage... Was it a mistake or a pre-meditated Free Publicity dictated by the organizers of the Pageant? Will it cost him his long and successful career, or it has costs the Miss Universe Pageant organization millions of dollars to make such mistake? I don't have the answer, you don't have the answer; but Mr. Steve Harvey has to answer all the questions, and for the damaged (emotional pain) it has done to Miss Colombia and the citizens of the said country. And I believe the Miss Universe organizer will have the answer or must give an answer to the whole world of what really happened. The Colombians and Miss Colombia were stunned and startled for the big announcement and of the awkward and big mistake of Mr. Steve Harvey. The Pageant organizers will definitely have to answer for the BIG mistake to settle down once and for all the doubt and wrong speculations of the people. Mr. Steve Harvey might have been briefed and instructed on which part of the card he should read or announce as the winner. Therefore, how in the world did he made such mistake considering Mr. Harvey is a professional television host? I felt sorry for Mr. Harvey, and I felt sorry for Miss Colombia , and for Colombians; but the true winner deserve to claim its prize, and get honor due for her. I also felt sorry for Miss Philippines for not having to walk with pride, get the crowning moment, and be recognized with honor and 15 seconds of glory. If it was an honest mistake, may the media and the whole world will learn to forgive Steve Harvey, and may the people of Colombia (the whole country) will gladly accept the stripping of the crown that was not due for her- Miss Colombia. This will be historic for the Miss Philippines who got the crown, and this is also historic for Miss Colombia who get the tastes of the crown, few minutes of glory, and tears of joy; but a nightmare, and a memory she don't want to retain in her minds. This is also historic to many Colombians who watched live and jump for joy when Miss Colombia was crowned. We don't want to miss the history Mr. Steve Harvey made on live tv and for the Miss Universe Pageant. So, who won and who was the loser? You will be the judge this time. But for me, all the contestants are winners already once they made their first step on that stage. Congratulations to all the contestants for making it to the Miss Universe Pageant. Just to be able to stand on that stage to represent your country is already an honor, and you are already a winner. Congratulations to Miss Philippines for being the best among the winner of winners. You made every Filipinos all over the world proud of you and proud of being a FILIPINO.
