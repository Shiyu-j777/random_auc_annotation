I went years with a sleep disorder and eventually went to a neurologist because I thought was having signs of dementia or something because my memory was horrible. After testing and MRI to rule out other possibilities she suggested I get my stress and sleep problems under control.After trying several things that had bad side effects and left me feeling like a zombie someone suggested essential oils. Bingo! It didn't happen overnight but over the next couple months of trying different combinations my sleep cycle corrected itself. It had made a world of difference in my mind functioning. I don't think people realize how much long term sleep issues can impact your brain. Sorry about the long story but thought it's something really important to think about.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0426,"user_ideo":-0.4018,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":1},{"user_id":10208771555680239,"comment_id":10153822377226316,"date":"2016-10-01","message":"This is heartbreaking.

Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":3},{"user_id":1122796324462358,"comment_id":823115277810146,"date":"2015-08-27","message":"that guy hates everyone","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3821,"user_ideo":-0.2841,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":4},{"user_id":10209577643671628,"comment_id":10153942937348145,"date":"2016-05-31","message":"Are there charges against the mother?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2689,"user_ideo":-0.1457,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":5},{"user_id":10154440785094394,"comment_id":10153171619626680,"date":"2015-11-23","message":"Add him to the long list of politicians who don't know or follow our Constitution anyway.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7497,"user_ideo":0.2285,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":6},{"user_id":1203294546368419,"comment_id":1007710145913663,"date":"2015-04-20","message":"Totally agree with you Elizabeth!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3767,"user_ideo":-0.8044,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":7},{"user_id":1085721688174675,"comment_id":10153563742159153,"date":"2015-08-27","message":"Thank you all!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3465,"user_ideo":-0.7132,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":8},{"user_id":1074295182655572,"comment_id":638823922908867,"date":"2016-11-26","message":"Mercy is it not so sad seems like anytime someone lets a fart now days it offends somone or they just gotta sue them this us getting old mercy folks stay your butts at home if your going to wear your feelings on your sleeves and quit being cry baby tattle tales !!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9977,"user_ideo":0.7071,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":9},{"user_id":10154408453963781,"comment_id":1360663833953366,"date":"2016-10-28","message":"Doesn't solve the problem for the salmon.
