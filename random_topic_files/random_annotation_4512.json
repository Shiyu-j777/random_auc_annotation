I don't play games to 'see myself represented in the media' I play games because they're fun. I'm not a black guy from the hood but GTA San An was still a great game. I'm not a woman but Beyond Good and Evil was a masterpiece. I'm not a black Scottish cyclops, but Team Fortress 2 is still a decade after release amazing fun. I'm not a magical elf wizard but Skyrim was still worth 300 hours. You don't play a game watching a character, you are the character. You are automatically represented simply by playing.

Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":15},{"user_id":1236656939679996,"comment_id":739930402833579,"date":"2017-02-14","message":"I had to read the headline three times to make sure I got it right","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3164,"user_ideo":-0.1193,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":16},{"user_id":10153967261576433,"comment_id":10153871603862434,"date":"2016-12-03","message":"Well, on one hand, Santas are usually vets, and vets come in all shades.
