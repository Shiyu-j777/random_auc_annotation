Do you what it's like to be a public servant?! To go to work everyday hoping to God when they call 911 they actually need help and aren't setting you up. To work on an ambulance, completely unarmed I add, and knock on a door to help a total stranger. Or to be a police officer and answer a calm to defend or protect people you've never met? If you don't know what it's like to be a public servant, furthermore a police officer, shut up and stop telling them how to do there jobs. I am not saying their all perfect but then again no one is. So I'll reiterate my previous statement. If you have nothing more intelligent to say than \"\"\"\"that's what you get\"\"\"\" in support of a man who killed 5 cops who had NOTHING to do with previous cop vs civilian situations than shut your ignorant mouth and stop spewing senseless hatred. You talk about uniting, but then you spew moronic, counterproductive, and misplaced anger and hatred.

The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":16},{"user_id":10102710686020459,"comment_id":10154484058123128,"date":"2016-07-15","message":"And how, pray tell, did he \"\"\"\"cheat the viewing world\"\"\"\"?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1422,"user_ideo":0.3412,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":17},{"user_id":1145461235495525,"comment_id":1246146308772865,"date":"2017-01-20","message":"Poor child being programmed to be an anarchist.
