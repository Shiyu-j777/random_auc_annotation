Blame the one thing that messes you up everyday. What is that? AUTO-CORRECT. Simple. Why blame autocorrect? For someone who quotes bible verses very regularly on social media like Steve does, I'm sure his Auto-Correct will pick \"\"\"\"Phillipians\"\"\"\" over \"\"\"\"Philippines\"\"\"\". Okay, he has traveled to Washington DC... his device will pick Columbia (as in District of Columbia) over \"\"\"\"Colombia\"\"\"\" Look, our devices learn about our habits, dialect, language... and corrects our messages accordingly. Now that we have his \"\"\"\"LACK OF KNOWLEDGE\"\"\"\" is cleared up, on to the big announcement \"\"\"\"mess-up\"\"\"\"... In TV/Broadcasting, you are trained to ALWAYS read what the teleprompter says regardless what a card you have in-hand has written. The teleprompter did in fact read the wrong information, where the card read different info. He cannot go blame technology in such a heated moment as that. He is being rare gentleman, and is accepting blame for the uh-oh. The pageant used to be owned by Donald Trump. Trump lost quite a bit of money after his Hispanic/Mexican Comments in heat of his Presidential campaign, and lost the support of Univision (Broadcaster of Mexico and other areas) as a negative result of his words. Knowing the motives of any big Money dude, I am not surprised. I firmly believe there was underhanded plays in motion and Steve was caught in this... In the wrong place at the wrong time.
