Why couldn't you have just seen this, said something to yourself, and moved on? What possessed you to make your initial post in the first place? Do you think after this couple reads it, they are going to quickly discover religion, get a divorce, and forever change their ways?

Propping it up as a exclusively Jewish artifact because it's in Hebrew (as if Palestinian history can't include the Jewish history of Palestine) is as absurd as the denigration of Arabic as a non-Jewish language, when in fact some of the great works of Jewish philosophy and poetry are in Arabic.
