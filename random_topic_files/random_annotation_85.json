I've agreed to disagree with you. Your logic is deplorable to say the least. You're giving them excuses and at the end of the day their idiotic judgment resulted in the accidental death of their child. You told me I don't know what I would have done....I told you what I would have done in this situation and now you're insisting one is neither right or wrong just different?? You may see it as being judgmental. I see it as facts that they made a horrible decision. \"\"\"\"No Swimming\"\"\"\" means NO. SWIMMING.

There are a confluence of geopolitical circumstances that suggest Putin will take action before mid-September 2016. President Obama¡¯s term is ending and President Putin also has critical Russian parliamentary elections on September 18, 2016. Putin has had to enact draconic anti-protest laws in the face of a high inflation rate, declining consumer demand, and expanding poverty among the middle class. A quick victory in the Ukraine should enhance his party¡¯s prestige before the election. Additionally, the strategic level Russian military exercises in the Western Military District are scheduled to begin 12 days before the parliamentary election on September 6, 2016. These exercises will provide cover for vast numbers of units and troops to converge on the exercise area near the Ukraine. The long range weather forecast is for perfectly sunny skies from August 23 to 6 September, 2016. Furthermore, President Putin recently fired his Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, who had been the Kremlin Chief of Staff and knew many high ranking officers in the Defense establishment. This firing of the Defense Minister could be considered an anti-coup preventative measure if Putin is indeed intending to go to war with men, material and live ammunition converging from all over Russia toward the Ukraine. I would suspect the optimum invasion window would be August 23, 2016 to September 6, 2016 taking advantage of the excellent weather, the exercise as cover to move troop and material, and allowing time for victory before the parliamentary elections.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4314,"user_ideo":0.3911,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":85},{"user_id":10208588356499799,"comment_id":365963853785502,"date":"2017-02-03","message":": Being black has nothing to do with his 128 broken campaign promises. I voted for Obama because I believed he was honest. The man had the House and the Senate, and instead of pushing our progressive agenda, he played chess with the GOP and lost both, the House and Senate in the mid-term elections. Why? Because young people and seniors like me were disappointed at his lack of performance. In 8 years, he did nothing for black, latinos, or seniors. He then supported rotten Hillary and the corrupt DNC, and ignored how Hillary and the DNC rigged the primaries from Sanders. Obama, just like Hillary, is a corporate pawn. If Obama was so smart and great champion of those in need, why he supported corrupt Hillary and not honest Bernie?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0014,"user_ideo":-0.7517,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":85},{"user_id":755848267851293,"comment_id":1789170258030624,"date":"2016-10-05","message":"Pence, charming and smooth next to his creepy car salesman opponent!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8827,"user_ideo":0.7627,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":85},{"user_id":738099189661782,"comment_id":10153057569327377,"date":"2015-09-26","message":"I love it !!!!
