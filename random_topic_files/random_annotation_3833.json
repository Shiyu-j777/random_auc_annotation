Woke up, as I usually do, at 2am to go to the bathroom and kept hearing a \"\"\"\"thump-thump-thump\"\"\"\", startlling me; turns out it was my left arm clanging on the wall, dead as a doornail. I was in the middle of having another stroke! Linda called my son who met us half way to the hospital and received treatment. However, i learned later to NEVER do that - call 911 instead. As soon as they arrive the EMT's begin treatment, forwarding vitals to the hospital, etc. and saves ER admittance time, also. Took 3 days before they'd let me out of bed to take a shower; they agreed I was ripe, lol~","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2261,"user_ideo":-0.6065,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":11},{"user_id":1224669120885693,"comment_id":1265409473477061,"date":"2016-05-14","message":"Funny that a man who outed homosexuals for LBJ is talking about lying =>","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4363,"user_ideo":0.3862,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":12},{"user_id":10209909816600138,"comment_id":10153370691851756,"date":"2015-04-04","message":"Interesting eh, Fisher ?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2418,"user_ideo":-0.6482,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":13},{"user_id":10208590487914021,"comment_id":10153836122426973,"date":"2016-07-18","message":"Wow.

What I do see are children gunned down, normal every day people at movies gun down, Universities students gun down, Marines gun down, people in a church gun down. This is real life for us now. Not a TV show. We are in a sad state of affairs. It's not the Presidents fault. He has talked and talked upon every slaughter.
