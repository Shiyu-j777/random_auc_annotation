The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":10},{"user_id":1130422523699696,"comment_id":10153810261800530,"date":"2015-10-28","message":"Well, I think I'll buy plain old paint and try to refrain from licking the walls!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5062,"user_ideo":-0.5018,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":11},{"user_id":520741191467026,"comment_id":10154455063289641,"date":"2016-09-05","message":"North Korea really hates the sea","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2906,"user_ideo":0.4569,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":12},{"user_id":10210248283384729,"comment_id":1296820253747557,"date":"2016-09-22","message":"Pence reminds me of Mister JerkDorf, the guy at junior high who ran after school detention, kind of like the classic 'Breakfast Club'....!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0091,"user_ideo":-0.8692,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":13},{"user_id":1381312711883001,"comment_id":10153521469283984,"date":"2015-06-26","message":"The DOA is a bully","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7642,"user_ideo":0.7262,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":14},{"user_id":1184081334987597,"comment_id":10156291338410594,"date":"2015-12-04","message":"Sears is in no way like it was.
