To rig a national election, to suppress American voters then get caught red handed, have the DNC head resign in disgrace, and within hours get hired by the Clinton campaign. This is the largest scandal in American history plain and simple. Well the Democratic party doubled down on what I consider a unelectable candidate none the less. It is my opinion that Hillary Clinton can not beat Donald Trump in election and rightfully so after shitting on our democracy. So with that say goodbye to democracy, to liberty and to the great nation we once knew. No self respecting person can vote for Hillary Clinton with the amount of fraud and scandals linked to her entire campaign. I'm not a religious man... but God save us all from these two presidential candidates. I am truly frightened and furious at the prospect of one of these two being elected president.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0092,"user_ideo":-0.4987,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":1365512046811626,"comment_id":717176235139621,"date":"2015-12-21","message":"Yep he didn't do anything wrong","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8579,"user_ideo":0.8077,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":10154289131550772,"comment_id":1658527127771423,"date":"2016-10-13","message":"Love well said ; tk u for your service sir","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9137,"user_ideo":0.293,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":576337942525900,"comment_id":696147457242499,"date":"2015-11-17","message":"The only strategy Obama has is to get as many terrorist into our country as he can before he is out of office.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.7762,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":163,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":10153972154088170,"comment_id":10153201338606756,"date":"2015-01-29","message":"Fuck Florida, Fuck GMOs, and Fuck mosquitoes, too.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0081,"user_ideo":-0.3495,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":1238368259507981,"comment_id":10157131266565389,"date":"2016-06-11","message":"trump2016 clean the crap out of washington","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.871,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":10210005130227979,"comment_id":10153309978863734,"date":"2015-05-08","message":"Would love to be able to see this!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4821,"user_ideo":0.546,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":832203183547429,"comment_id":10153206791381130,"date":"2015-07-13","message":"Didn't know people actually still go here....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4739,"user_ideo":-0.3808,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":5,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":1393239990692775,"comment_id":10154151159069087,"date":"2016-10-07","message":"get out the popcorn","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.173,"user_ideo":0.6006,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":10157219329805117,"comment_id":10154420470776523,"date":"2017-01-27","message":"Good job, karma!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2509,"user_ideo":0.3206,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":206,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":1526336114062451,"comment_id":1361041087260463,"date":"2017-01-08","message":"KUDOS to !!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7748,"user_ideo":-0.2897,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":102,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1087},{"user_id":10209630755978430,"comment_id":10153214794538690,"date":"2015-02-25","message":"Well you want the world to see how beautiful your faith is.
