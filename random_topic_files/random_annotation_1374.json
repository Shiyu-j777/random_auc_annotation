It relays on taking both races, putting them on an even playing field to show one race is higher than other if they were equal. There are several problems with Per Cap 1. The number aren't equal and white actually do commit more crimes. 2. Per Cap doesn't account for the number of crime that have been commit by the same persons. 3. Doesn¡¯t account for the number of people that have been vindicated from a crime 4. Does not account for the number of plea bargains, wrongful convictions, and so on. 5. The integration of Hispanics to whites aids the percentage without Hispanics in the calculation of white crime \"\"\"\"Per cap\"\"\"\" percentage would be much higher. 6. \"\"\"\"Per cap\"\"\"\" don't show racial profiling or the lack of, versus the groups. As well as media bias, social programming and how each plays a role in our justice system (all which affect the count) 7. Per Cap and the whole number by themselves do not get an accurate (Whole) view of what¡¯s really going on in society, but are used as such. Furthermore, the way per cap is used is wrong, We put both races on a curve and then use the curve to predict crime. Every with all the issues I mention above. 8. The crime rates change when you break them down going state by state. The view is different. 9. Per Cap doesn¡¯t account for the fact that Black communities are often targeted for crimes where as white communities Are not,,,, producing more crime stats on one but not the other. The overall racial stereotypes play a huge role in these numbers and the acquiring of them as well as prison for profit and social programming. If we remove Hispanics from the white columns, Racial profiled whites at the same rate as blacks, as well as the same conviction rate for both per a crime and treated black crime as white crime is treat (individual VS group) You¡¯d have a good argument, if the numbers stayed the same. The truth is they would not.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0905,"user_ideo":-0.7635,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":236,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1374},{"user_id":1519079361440210,"comment_id":10153937328896051,"date":"2016-07-25","message":"Inappropriate for a family venue.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4849,"user_ideo":-0.3724,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":236,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1374},{"user_id":10211040291342363,"comment_id":654838421341279,"date":"2016-10-06","message":"...
