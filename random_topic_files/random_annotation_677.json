It's funny how these people think that someone should not have rights because of the bible, the bible that has no place in government. This country was founded upon religious freedom, not religious freedom for everyone as long as they are christians, that's not how it works, if you don't like gay people, stay away, I don't like right wings very much, it's why I avoid them like the plague. If we are going to replace the constitution with the bible, which cannot & will not ever happen, you cannot pick & choose, divorce is also a sin, as is lying, cheating, stealing, & a number of other things that these people do.
