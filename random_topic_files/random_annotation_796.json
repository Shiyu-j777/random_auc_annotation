Not dreaming of anything, going back to my original point, I suppose it wasn't clear enough, but Lurie is desperate, weak, and impatient. The issues in that locker room were fixable if they operated as an organization. Lurie talked about maximizing Chip, why? There were only two other coaches afforded that power in the NFL and two years in the NFL hardly warrants that without some oversight, Lurie is making decisions based on the influence of others. He calls this experiment a dumpster fire and then he and the same guy who hired Chip Are going to hire the next guy. Chip isn't the only one with issues. Just a year ago Lurie said something like there were no demands for GM and that he was passionate about seeing chips plan come to life over time. So who is worse, the guy who took risks and failed or the guy who put the gun in his hand and gave in to the fans the second he saw some empty seats?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1052,"user_ideo":-0.3876,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":796},{"user_id":10209968395469220,"comment_id":10153995227399641,"date":"2016-03-25","message":"Daniel but we don't slaughter dolphins because we think they are pests when, in actuality, they are probably smarter than those killing them.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0504,"user_ideo":-0.6683,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":796},{"user_id":10211675234136944,"comment_id":10154431790724641,"date":"2016-08-29","message":"i WANT ONE","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4048,"user_ideo":-0.1598,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":19,"json_serial_number":796},{"user_id":10207104547035625,"comment_id":962331627193225,"date":"2015-09-28","message":"They are in the pocket of the fossil fuel lobby.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0034,"user_ideo":-0.853,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":20,"json_serial_number":796}]
