If anything...between the force reductions, sustained ops tempo, ousting of an unprecedented # of senior leaders, softer/gentler training tactics, reduced training standards, conversion to civilian contractors in place of military bodies, our military is struggling.

Less than 20% of congress has ever served, how would they know what's best for the military?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9887,"user_ideo":0.2682,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":3},{"user_id":601395346721943,"comment_id":10154273408619071,"date":"2017-01-10","message":"Good Service","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7761,"user_ideo":-0.2903,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":4},{"user_id":10205158844889297,"comment_id":10154447353296002,"date":"2015-12-18","message":"You as well :)","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2167,"user_ideo":0.1264,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":5},{"user_id":1758305164441382,"comment_id":964287383689209,"date":"2016-07-02","message":"I have no words.
