Saying they disagree is beginning to sound hollow so Republicans have taken another tack. They promise that the courts and Congress will safeguard the United States from Trump's authoritarian whims. If the New York businessman begins carrying out an agenda from the White House that looks anything like the one he's proposed on the campaign trailâ€“ like a ban on Muslims â€“Republicans promise the Constitution guarantees there will be a check and a balance. In other words, Republicans are saying their nominee is so awful that they need to reassure fearful Americans that they will â€œstep inâ€ to contain him, should he ever become President. As Fox notes, Mitch McConnell, John McCain and top Republican strategists have all echoed this point during the last few days, apparently operating under the delusion that a Party that has accomplished absolutely nothing legislatively during the past eight years could somehow be counted on to take on an aberrant and malevolent Executive Branch. Thatâ€s not only pathetic, itâ€s sick, as many were quick to point out: \"\"\"\"One might think that if you are suggesting that the country is strong enough to constrain a potentially authoritarian leader, it might be a good idea not to elect that potentially authoritarian leader in the first place,\"\"\"\"","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0015,"user_ideo":-0.8516,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":88,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":881},{"user_id":10209959314569210,"comment_id":10153262962293145,"date":"2015-07-28","message":"Typical judgemental know nothings that never bother investigating the facts before they start running their mouths.
