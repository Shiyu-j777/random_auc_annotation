Why? One stumble (last week it was a squeaker win due to a tough defense causing problems for the Bronco offense) and the cries were: Manning sucks, fire Manning, bring back Tebow, the Broncos should have never signed Manning.....completely ignoring the facts.....Manning has led the Broncos (just as he did the Colts) to victory after victory.....to the playoffs , to the super bowl.....and owns more NFL QB records than most folks can name off the top of their head. It is a team sport....and if you are a TRUE fan, you pick your horse and you ride it.....good or bad.
