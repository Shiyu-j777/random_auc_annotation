Once again someone basis their opinions on what the media told them. New Orleans is my home. And just like any place it has it's good and bad. You based your opinion on what the media saw as a story. Not the truth. We live away from the city at the time. We still sat without electricity or running water for weeks!!! We weren't even part of the evacuated area. We literally lived in Vienna sausages and Spam from a can. And we rationed our bottled water and still feared starvation and dehydration. The heat was 100 degrees and we didn't even have a way to use a fan. Do you happen to remember the media reports about FEMA??? They took weeks to respond and give aid? No I guess you don't remember all of that.
