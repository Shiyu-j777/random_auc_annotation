You think an animal is a slave just because it lives in a cage. Well there are many people in this world who live in a cage without bars. They think an animal life is more important than a human life. It's their religion of choice, worshiping mother nature. You may even believe that the animal has a soul. Only man, made in the image of God has an eternal soul. Animals are special as pets, and those trainers at zoos and Sea World treat those animals special, but when it comes right down to it, they are not as valuable as a single murdering, thieving, lying person. Even you Beant. We didn't start off as an amoeba, a mouse or a cow and we move up the chain. The worst human is greater than the best animal in God's view. Why? Because God made us in His image, with a soul which is holy and perfect. We through sin, have rejected God's purity and must live in this fallen world until He returns. Some of your fellow animal rights people would put you in cage over a monkey or a rat even if they were honest because most don't value humans as much as an animal's life, (except their own life of course). But if you say every animal in the world wants to be free, then you are against people having dogs, cats, birds and fish as pets then.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9924,"user_ideo":0.7782,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":109},{"user_id":10155106207854992,"comment_id":1095566190526525,"date":"2016-07-28","message":"My thoughts exactly !
