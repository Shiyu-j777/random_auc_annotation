This is Mr. Trumps statement on what he said, so unless your bent on calling him a liar, than maybe you will rethink your jumping on the band wagon. Unless you just aren't his fan and want to think badly of him without being fair. I as a Christian choose to believe his statement. I just believe it! I believe he will tell you if he thinks a certain way. He isn't afraid to talk. That is how he talks. He starts something and then will just trail off to what is important and not get bogged down. If you listen to him often you start adapting to how he talks and you get him. Those that haven't been interested in figuring Mr. Trump out are taking the wrong responses of people who are looking for any ammunition against him to destroy him twist his statements and quote them as factual. He said several times he didn't go down the path that others did on his statement and really can't believe that they would. To be truthful when I heard him say the statement, my mind didn't come to that conclusion and when others started saying he said that, it turned my stomach to think they would accuse him of that and I wondered on how their mind works. Tonight got us back on track. I give koodoos to Fox and Hannity to put an end to what Megyn started.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.7147,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":227,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":964},{"user_id":10155604135293047,"comment_id":10153186461157217,"date":"2015-11-03","message":"What a dreadful thing to say Jennifer...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1461,"user_ideo":-0.2507,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":964},{"user_id":10210748775854622,"comment_id":10153076663869575,"date":"2015-01-07","message":"Freaking wonderful...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2465,"user_ideo":0.305,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":210,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":964},{"user_id":319481188401728,"comment_id":10156604268905354,"date":"2016-01-10","message":"3482 Paul Ryan: Donald Trump or Ted Cruz would be a ¡far better president than Barack Obama¡¯ Dylan Stableford January 7, 2016 House Speaker Paul D. Ryan says the country would ¡°absolutely¡± be better off with Donald Trump or Ted Cruz as commander in chief than President Obama. ¡°I think any one of these men or women running for president in the Republican primary would be a far better president than Barack Obama,¡± Ryan told Yahoo News¡¯ Katie Couric in an exclusive interview on Wednesday. ¡°Absolutely.¡± The Wisconsin congressman and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee believes Obama¡¯s legacy is one of divisiveness. ¡°My guess is the way he would look at it is he advanced liberal progressivism farther than anybody since Woodrow Wilson,¡± Ryan said. ¡°I think he sees himself in that sort of pantheon of progressives. What that means to me as a constitutional conservative is that he has drifted the country away from the Constitution.¡± Relief is here: NyQuil & DayQuilSponsored Ryan continued: We have a Constitution to protect our liberties as citizens they¡¯re God-given; they¡¯re not government-granted. And I think he subscribes to a different theory, that the Constitution is some living, breathing document that he can shape and move and form. What that philosophy at the end of the day does, in my opinion, is it takes power away from people in this country and gives it to unelected bureaucrats in Washington to micromanage our lives. So I think his philosophy of government he¡¯s kind of dogmatic about it is a very condescending, paternalistic and arrogant philosophy which I think takes power away from people. As a result, we¡¯re less prosperous. We¡¯re less safe. We have less upward mobility. We have less prosperity. And I think the anxiety that is palpable in America and this isn¡¯t just anxiety among Republicans, this is anxiety among all Americans I think it is a direct result of the polarization that comes with this identity politics, the polarization that comes with having anemic economic growth and having an unsecure national security stance. So that¡¯s, I think, the legacy.
