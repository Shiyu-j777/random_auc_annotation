The suspect himself said this was race related- regardless of whether it was in the workplace or not... In his manifesto, he pinpoints that this is all due to racism... that this is what drove him to do what he did... I'm not saying racism doesn't exist and drive people to kill, because look at what happened at the Church in Charleston... but that guy targeted a race as a whole- and (it is being reported) that this guy targeted old co-workers because his Equal Employment Opportunity claim was denied... (it is being reported that) he was fired because of accusations made against him by these two at points back in his career in 2012-2013, and he is sour that they hired her on as an anchor after her internship, and he lost his job... that's why he tweeted all of those tweets... His previous managers even report that he was difficulty to work with, he had anger issues, he was paranoid, and would look for things that people would say that he could twist around to take offense to and then cry racism...
