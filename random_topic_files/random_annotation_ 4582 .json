I also had a fraternal twin brother. We would of been triplets. Weird stuff... * Chimera: In medicine, a person composed of two genetically distinct types of cells. Human chimeras were first discovered with the advent of blood typing when it was found that some people had more than one blood type. Most of them proved to be \"\"\"\"blood chimeras\"\"\"\" -- non-identical twins who shared a blood supply in the uterus. Those who were not twins are thought to have blood cells from a twin that died early in gestation. Twin embryos often share a blood supply in the placenta, allowing blood stem cells to pass from one and settle in the bone marrow of the other. About 8% of non-identical twin pairs are chimeras.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2459,"user_ideo":-0.1835,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":1},{"user_id":1149474155146744,"comment_id":10153285196176350,"date":"2015-04-13","message":"Skin graft to cover shotgun wound.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4029,"user_ideo":0.635,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":2},{"user_id":1109267005779251,"comment_id":10152845635688721,"date":"2015-03-31","message":"lol, I'll check it out when it's finished...but I'm really enjoying Elite Dangerous in the meantime","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2083,"user_ideo":-0.7431,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":3},{"user_id":1231997476895175,"comment_id":1115692555117766,"date":"2016-04-10","message":"Donald Trump to reset America in order of Donald Reagan.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9413,"user_ideo":-0.0878,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":4},{"user_id":10206873855669877,"comment_id":10153243118802093,"date":"2015-12-31","message":"Should've added a link to the gofundme page.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1297,"user_ideo":0.1444,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":5},{"user_id":1271075922904909,"comment_id":10154514833613822,"date":"2017-01-28","message":"The Haitians protested the Clinton foundation because they never received a penny of the millions of dollars that was sent to the Clinton foundation for Haitian relief.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5574,"user_ideo":0.3216,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":6},{"user_id":10209926637379954,"comment_id":1117729418250279,"date":"2016-07-06","message":"Therefore anyone wanting a gun should be required to take a battery of classes and prove their competence in it's use and safe keeping.
