Thinking he is dumb or naive. He ie a brilliant, Evil, spokes mouth. He has managed to distract everyone. While we've been busy complaining about his executive orders, Iran Deal, his divisive speeches regarding same sex marriage gun grabbing initiatives, Benghazi, Baltimore, Chicago. He has been flooding America with Criminals, releasing Ghitmo prisoners of war, releasing drug dealer from federal prisons with records of violent crimes, supporting sanctuary cities and building his own private military that answers only to him. He has replaced 5 Star Generals and other Military leaders with Military Nobody's, He has Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood personnel in THE WHITE HOUSE DAILY . The United States of America Is under Internal Attack and the only thing standing between these Enemies within are the CIA/FBI/ and major last line of defense who are planted throughout Government mainly the Military.

Women have, on average, 2.5 children over the course of 50 or so years in the workforce. The number of women that will need to pump during work in the same time period in the same workplace is going to be a pretty low percentage. Plus, most employers already do this out of basic human decency. When I worked in an office and pumped twice a day, I took my laptop with me and continued to work. I took way less break time than the smokers.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0308,"user_ideo":-0.5477,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":14},{"user_id":286955078332082,"comment_id":10155068550481509,"date":"2016-07-22","message":"Do you have State Farm insurance, if you have the towing with them you better cancel it and get a towing card like AAA because if you use it couple of times they will cancel you!

Not every black person is a criminal, in fact I have several friends who are Doctors and professionals. Not all white people are racist. Not all of us think people who aren't white are inferior. However, unfortunately in this country negativity gets the press. The ones of us who exist side by side and work hard, live within the law, and behave accordingly never make the news.

This is such a misleading article. I'm not even into games, but find this highly offensive from an accurate truth point of view. I do hope the title is meant to be read as a sign of hope, people pay that money because they probably want to see the game be made. How can you expect a fully functional game of that size before putting in considerable amounts of money? Just think of the latest GTA with a 1/4 of a billion funding.
