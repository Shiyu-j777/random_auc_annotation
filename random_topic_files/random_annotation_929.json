Women have, on average, 2.5 children over the course of 50 or so years in the workforce. The number of women that will need to pump during work in the same time period in the same workplace is going to be a pretty low percentage.

I took way less break time than the smokers.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0308,"user_ideo":-0.5477,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":3},{"user_id":10207147913878338,"comment_id":1277004712319556,"date":"2016-01-04","message":"You know what you should do, you so-called Adolf Reich, too chicken-sh1+ to use your real name.
