Get yourself a wedding photographer (not just any photographer, an actual wedding photographer!). It is after all, a once (or twice, or thrice for some?) in a lifetime event that you want to have amazing pictures of and while yes your family and friends will take photos and all, do you seriously want to leave it to chance?

Save expenses somewhere else: invite a couple less people, get another venue, maybe even go for other flower arrangements, etc but definitely don't skimp on the photographer!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0106,"user_ideo":-0.6743,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":3},{"user_id":10210745784668876,"comment_id":10154166792483279,"date":"2016-05-26","message":"You mean the 11 judges, from which 9 were appointed by her party? =D Yeah, right. ;)","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0943,"user_ideo":-0.4835,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":4},{"user_id":1402281666454362,"comment_id":10156107751530354,"date":"2015-09-05","message":"THEN GET A JOB!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9707,"user_ideo":0.7339,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":5},{"user_id":10154797744720540,"comment_id":1274908982525420,"date":"2015-12-10","message":"No wonder I am never depressed...am addicted to fresh raw cashews(make my own cashew milk and cashew grain free bread) also love freshly cracked walnuts, almonds, macadamias, pistashios and peanuts(though officially not a nut rather a legume).","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0363,"user_ideo":0.0541,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":6},{"user_id":1055541081148203,"comment_id":10155463200738797,"date":"2017-02-23","message":"Build the wall around California too.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.987,"user_ideo":-0.3344,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":7},{"user_id":10206820606009145,"comment_id":10153628972444087,"date":"2016-03-22","message":"me too!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2586,"user_ideo":-0.712,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":8},{"user_id":10206988213611480,"comment_id":10154056692257391,"date":"2017-01-24","message":"God bless the new President and the United States of America","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9951,"user_ideo":0.8109,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":9},{"user_id":659597100873546,"comment_id":10153363806003984,"date":"2015-05-06","message":"Good job","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.879,"user_ideo":0.813,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":10},{"user_id":10153571853761222,"comment_id":1264418143578213,"date":"2015-12-16","message":"He's big boned.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2391,"user_ideo":-0.4465,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":11},{"user_id":10154453808263750,"comment_id":10153081286259701,"date":"2015-02-03","message":"Hera","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2279,"user_ideo":0.0041,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":12},{"user_id":10208477357951649,"comment_id":10155333083534778,"date":"2016-10-03","message":"Beautiful story","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5394,"user_ideo":-0.4471,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":13},{"user_id":1765102467111946,"comment_id":10153190436886770,"date":"2015-12-20","message":"Affiliations at LARGE!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3814,"user_ideo":0.9019,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":14},{"user_id":10154926979479156,"comment_id":1056122104408145,"date":"2016-01-06","message":"America today: A black child with a toy gun on a play ground is a threat.
