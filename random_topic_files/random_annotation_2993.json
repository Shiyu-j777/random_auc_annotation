Sounds like you had issues absorbing iron and possibly you weren't taking B12 supplements.

Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so. That decision to have your child is yours, just like it was her decision to terminate.
