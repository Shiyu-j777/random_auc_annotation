Thats what people keep missing. It doesnt matter about the girls hair! her hair isnt a detriment to her ability to perform. By this logic lets say a job(which plenty do) - say you have to have straight hair....Or the military...... Dont you see how this is overwhelmingly discriminatory??? Maybe the cheer companies should expand its policy to be more inclusive of different hair textures. Maybe all cheer companies should do the same. All Jobs, and our military. We ont need to change - the standards do. A white girl would never be asked to get an afro textured perm. LOL. what if this girl had dreads? I guess shes just shit out of luck from cheering, jobs, and the miliitary. lol. Stop excepting your own erasure. black girls deserve to wear their hair as it naturally grows out of their scalp just as much as little white girls do.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0506,"user_ideo":-0.6439,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":136,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":946},{"user_id":10206121143660124,"comment_id":10152970339911973,"date":"2015-05-31","message":"Scumbag owners.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2518,"user_ideo":-0.3231,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":136,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":946},{"user_id":10208596126414131,"comment_id":10154522048692232,"date":"2016-09-20","message":"No...
