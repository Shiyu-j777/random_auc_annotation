Women have, on average, 2.5 children over the course of 50 or so years in the workforce. The number of women that will need to pump during work in the same time period in the same workplace is going to be a pretty low percentage. Plus, most employers already do this out of basic human decency. When I worked in an office and pumped twice a day, I took my laptop with me and continued to work. I took way less break time than the smokers.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0308,"user_ideo":-0.5477,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":2},{"user_id":285785505118214,"comment_id":10156924119845725,"date":"2016-04-13","message":"Nice, John...I just watched that video, that guy is the man!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4505,"user_ideo":0.5869,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":3},{"user_id":1298828320140651,"comment_id":10154102597201135,"date":"2017-01-14","message":"Hi Carolyn Clifford, I loved your dress","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6734,"user_ideo":-0.3446,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":4},{"user_id":10210374471662396,"comment_id":10153662547186077,"date":"2016-01-26","message":"Seriously!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4091,"user_ideo":0.2009,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":5},{"user_id":10153619691385880,"comment_id":1168968836550965,"date":"2016-11-10","message":"It sounds like you're the one who has a problem with one but not the other, but ok, I'm the hypocrite.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1498,"user_ideo":-0.5399,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":6},{"user_id":644291685731365,"comment_id":10153358516169641,"date":"2015-06-26","message":"Margaritas are gay lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1792,"user_ideo":-0.3105,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":7},{"user_id":10210089873744405,"comment_id":10153819009391336,"date":"2015-11-07","message":"But how are you supposed to post it on Instagram?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0212,"user_ideo":0.8001,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":8},{"user_id":10210652450014853,"comment_id":10153303452644411,"date":"2015-04-23","message":"and his Australian heritage......nah Im just a Liverpool fan who wants to make the general public aware of what that newspaper that I would not say its name again had done to a worldwide institution that is Liverpool Football Club.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0444,"user_ideo":-0.22,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":9},{"user_id":10208776137376252,"comment_id":10153692284886323,"date":"2015-10-13","message":"Yup it's art .
