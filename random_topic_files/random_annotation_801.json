It's no wonder America is so far behind in education..our kids are out of school more than they are in school. Kansas does a better job plowing in some areas. Others, you are lucky if you even see a plow. I worked in missouri, from Independence to the Northland. Plowing is horrible there. If the plowing and salting was done early enough, there should be no reason to cancel school for only a couple of inches. They knew snow was coming. Why weren't they out plowing and salting all night? The highways look barely touched.
