The Jewish people have their holidays, and are able to take them off as legal holidays. In fact, when my kids were in school, their \"\"\"\"holiday\"\"\"\" play included Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and their REAL meanings, yet left out the true meaning of Christmas. They only correlated Christmas with Santa and Rudolph. You can go to the store and find things for those religions. But, this has been a primarily Judeau-Christian nation. The courts were decorated with The Ten Commandments and our dollars embellished with In God We Trust. What I do see is an all-out assault on Christianity and anything correlating to Christmas as a Christian holiday. Sad that there are people so offended by the birth of Jesus, the savior, but it was foretold that this would happen. Oh, and for the record, I wouldn't file a complaint if a teacher had a Kwanzaa decoration displayed or if Hindu had one displayed. It doesn't offend me that they choose to practice or celebrate their religion and holidays. My celebration shouldn't offend them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9801,"user_ideo":0.5228,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":9},{"user_id":1048425028578563,"comment_id":1660426090844318,"date":"2015-08-16","message":"Another in the LONG list of reasons to legalize the cultivation of a plant that God DESIGNED us to have!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1606,"user_ideo":0.0436,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":10},{"user_id":1483390935012066,"comment_id":10155744688660354,"date":"2015-06-15","message":"she did not have to Kiss nobody's ass and apologize for what she saidit was a mistake so don't take it and run with it","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5798,"user_ideo":-0.4715,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":11},{"user_id":1227820677285656,"comment_id":10153104053669170,"date":"2015-02-05","message":"Bo needs a history lesson...when he was shown in the White House kitchen with the beer he brewed, he said that the only other President who brewed beer in the White House was George Washington...Bo, FYI..George Washington never lived in the WH,,it wasn't built when he was President... if George Bush had made that mistake, the liberal main stream media would have plastered his mistake all over the papers and on TV...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.762,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":12},{"user_id":10207325493202103,"comment_id":1394448407242178,"date":"2017-02-15","message":"Again..though deeming the leaks criminal but not calling them wrong.

It's about listening to music, watching TV, playing video games, and using social media. You can't complain about social media and then turn around and let your kid watch TV for 4 hours a night or play video games until it's bed time. None of this stuff is bad in moderation. My daughter plays Minecraft, listens to music, reads books, plays outside, and watches TV on top of being active in karate and now swimming. Before you knock on the habits of teens, take a look at yourself.
