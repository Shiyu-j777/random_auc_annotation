These documents give conclusive proof that America is a Christian nation. One does not need a law degree or a degree in history to grasp this truth. It is obvious to anyone who does not have an agenda. Declaration of Independence: The Declaration has many references to God throughout the document. The most famous one is that men are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights. “We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness” Here are more references to God found in the document: Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” Appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World” With a firm Reliance on the Protection of Divine Providence” Article 33 of that first Constitution read this way: \"\"\"\"That, as it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to him; all persons, professing the Christian religion, are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; \"\"\"\"wherefore no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate on account of his religious persuasion or profession, or for his religious practice.... \"\"\"\"yet the Legislature may, in their discretion, lay a general and equal tax for the support of the Christian religion.\"\"\"\" Article 55 laid down the following requirement for anyone who wanted to serve in public office in the newly established state: \"\"\"\"That every person, appointed to any office... shall... take the following oath: \"\"\"\"I...do swear, that I do not hold myself bound in allegiance to the King of Great Britain, and that I will be faithful, and bear true allegiance to the State of Maryland; and shall also subscribe a declaration of his belief in the Christian religion.\"\"\"\" In other words, no one but Christians were allowed to hold public office. Now Maryland's constitution has undergone subsequent revisions, but still to this day it requires \"\"\"\"a declaration of belief in the existence of GOD\"\"\"\" as a qualification for holding elected office.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9958,"user_ideo":0.2805,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":261,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":880},{"user_id":10210373713167442,"comment_id":10155989490845231,"date":"2015-09-17","message":"Are u kidding!!
