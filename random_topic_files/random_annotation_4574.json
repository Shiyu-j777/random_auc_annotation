The loss will be significant and remove a substantial amount of progress that occurred over the last 82 years. So if trump wins, we will not die. We'll just be weakened as a people. Hereâ€s why. If you examine the 5 key reasons people use to vote for him - and then separate that from the core of him - the remains are staggering. 1)- (the 1st key reason) \"\"\"\"He says what he means.\"\"\"\" Actually, he changes what he means the very next day to suit whatever he thinks you want to hear. So we can no longer use that as a positive attribute. 2)- \"\"\"\"He has his own money so he doesn't need to answer to anybody.\"\"\"\" Well for months now, and especially recently, he declared that he will need to use millions of RNC funds and donated money in order to run in the general election. The RNC, The Koch brothers, and other huge backers of republicans are waiting for him to tone down his â€œhateful rhetoric and moronic statementsâ€ before they can commit to helping. The bulk of trumps assets are not liquid (mainly on paper) so he needs to become beholden to favors, lobbyists, and whomever else has money. So that argument can no longer be used. 3)- \"\"\"\"He's a successful business man\"\"\"\". Quite frankly, trumps book should have started out like this - \"\"\"\"The number one key to success is to make sure you do everything you can, to insure, without a hitch, that you are born into wealth.\"\"\"\" First of all, one would have to be an imbecile to be given millions of dollars, then inherit millions of more in cash and property, and let it completely falter. Secondly, he is one of the most sued real estate businessmen alive. When you add those 2 things, along with bankruptcy's, and several failed businesses, we can no longer use â€œsuccessful business manâ€ as a reason. 4)- \"\"\"\"He's an outsider\"\"\"\". In truth, he's as much an outsider as Osama Bin Laden was a Christian. Trump has draped himself and hob knobbed around politicians all of his adult life. He has been part of the 1 percent (that you hate) his entire life. He has abused tax loop holes and created tax havens in other countries for as long as the IRS can remember. So this â€œoutsiderâ€ concept is also no longer viable. 5)- \"\"\"\"He's tapping into the anger of the people\"\"\"\". Which people? The very people (who say they are angry about something) are the same people, who for the last 7 years, did absolutely nothing, zero, nada, as in - not written one single letter to their elected officials who blocked valuable things from ever seeing the light of day. If you took a moment to check, you would discover that many of the things they say they want (and wanted) were prevented from happening by their own republican elected officials. These so called â€œangryâ€ people, willingly forfeited great things for themselves and their communities and allowed severe obstructionism to happen because they were somehow convinced it was for a necessary cause. So again, that is also no longer a viable reason to put forth. So, what you have left is the core of the man. Since none of us knows jack squat about this man, you should stop proclaiming you do. But what we are learning about him is that he is rude, offensive, and doesn't think much before speaking. He is an avowed race baiter who blatantly instills fear and hate in Americans as much as he can. He has tapped into the underbelly of this nation and gratefully embraced it because those millions of extra votes - are very much needed â€“ and helping him win. So taking away the 5 things you once tried to proclaim as attributes, we are left with a man who has draped a huge part of his campaign in bigotry, sexism, racism, violence, and misogyny. He has compelled thousands of Muslims to consider joining whatever radical group possible in order to stop the hate he wrongly spews against the majority of Muslims and others who fight in our wars and die for us. So if he somehow wins â€“ we wonâ€t all die. But - we've already had a try with gunslingers (non-pragmatic thinkers) in the White House. We experienced how horrible a journey that was. At the end of that excruciating time, when everyone swore this country was going off the proverbial cliff â€“ we somehow didnâ€t. And as an added bonus - over the last 7 years, Americans chipped in and helped turn things around. Period. Done. Happened. Turned around. (now all that is left is useless speculation as to how much happened and what actually happened) So since the 5 key reasons for voting for him all have huge holes in them, letâ€s be extremely mindful of the callous core of this man and not elect someone who will set us backwards again - while simultaneously having more and more Muslims, Latinos, and women around the world and the country - hate us. I hope the RNC or Independent party can find someone else to run.
