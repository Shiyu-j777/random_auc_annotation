The investigation announcement came over the weekend in response to conservative lawmakerâ€s charges of public corruption. Thatâ€s according to a report by The Daily Callerâ€s Richard Pollock, which first reported on the July 22nd IRS letter that acknowledged the tax agency had officially â€œforwarded the information to our Exempt Organizations Examination programâ€ which â€œconsiders all referralsâ€ from the IRS chief.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9913,"user_ideo":0.6432,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":890},{"user_id":10208745571228951,"comment_id":10154431001773812,"date":"2016-05-24","message":"My Siamese cat isn't from Siam either.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.129,"user_ideo":-0.2481,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":890},{"user_id":1746736172263790,"comment_id":579156695599060,"date":"2016-05-11","message":"god please heal him.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8962,"user_ideo":-0.1132,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":136,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":890},{"user_id":10205045137927411,"comment_id":10153402540329586,"date":"2015-06-12","message":"I can't love this more than I do now lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1265,"user_ideo":-0.5523,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":890},{"user_id":10210145722576416,"comment_id":10153656101006770,"date":"2016-07-24","message":"So?
