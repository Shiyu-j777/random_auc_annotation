It's tight between the eyes, right behind the skull and dangles in front of the brain. I sorry have a pituitary adenoma. The surgery is possible if the conditions are right. Usually they opt to treat with medication first. If the tumor is pressing on the optic nerve or if it's wrapped around the carotid artery, they cannot perform the surgery without risk of blindness or a bleed out. Pituitary disease influences mood swing, weight management, patience, fatigue levels, and certainly depression. Prolactinoma tumors are one of the most common adenomas and are usually, but not always, treatable with medication.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.047,"user_ideo":-0.4626,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":95,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":717},{"user_id":10202028334826112,"comment_id":1253211354698892,"date":"2015-11-29","message":"Great job","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8768,"user_ideo":0.2917,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":95,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":717},{"user_id":1344375365590396,"comment_id":10153029386591336,"date":"2015-03-03","message":"Makes me feel like a jerk when i think how blessed i am to have the life ido .
