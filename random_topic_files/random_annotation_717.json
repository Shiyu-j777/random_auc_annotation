This Democratic Socialism is a federal government ideology. Police and fire is paid by local taxes, most roadway construction and maintenance is on a local level and state level. Federal highways receive federal money but state DOTs oversee the expenditure of capital. Medicaid is also state level. So to call all the services a form of Democratic Socialism is a bunch of malarky. If I could opt of of Social Security I would. If I could opt out of Medicare I would. I don't use USPS I use UPS or Fedex. Problem with supporters of Deoncratic Socialism here in this country is they don't even know what that term means. They dont know what Capitalism means either. They dont understand the greatest increase in the size of the middle class did not come from gvt spending and regulation, it came from a mich truer form of capitalism, not crony capitalism Lets have the majority by vote impose their ideology of collectivism over individualism on the minority and call it Democratic Socialism.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9873,"user_ideo":0.7089,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":717},{"user_id":1253263288031307,"comment_id":10153372375986378,"date":"2015-12-22","message":"Hey guys you can still buy online and have it for pick up sat stores the stores are ridiculous so check out and get cash back for your holiday gifts plus price comparison over 4,000 stores","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6178,"user_ideo":-0.5252,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":717},{"user_id":1232344460149842,"comment_id":10154375359066509,"date":"2016-01-12","message":"That's what friends are for !","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6319,"user_ideo":-0.2008,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":717},{"user_id":324060694603405,"comment_id":10154301437591378,"date":"2017-01-04","message":"I am so sorry","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.537,"user_ideo":-0.1874,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":95,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":717},{"user_id":1140087529380954,"comment_id":10153294714211770,"date":"2016-02-13","message":"i dont believe in the draft for women . & i dont care what they fought for way back when . it should be volunteer for women .","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9162,"user_ideo":0.797,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":717},{"user_id":1305585536133347,"comment_id":1738441219756882,"date":"2016-07-23","message":"Bernie Sanders DID NOT CONCEDE -- he ENDORSED the \"\"\"\"presumptive nominee\"\"\"\" only to 1) UNIFY OPPOSITION TO TRUMp, 2) INFLUENCE THE DEM PARTY PLATFORM, and 3) REMAIN IN THE CONVENTION WITH HIS DELEGATES THERE IN FULL FORCE (while simultaneously, super delegates are being urged to switch to VOTE SANDERS).
