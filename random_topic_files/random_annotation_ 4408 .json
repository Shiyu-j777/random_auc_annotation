I went years with a sleep disorder and eventually went to a neurologist because I thought was having signs of dementia or something because my memory was horrible. After testing and MRI to rule out other possibilities she suggested I get my stress and sleep problems under control.After trying several things that had bad side effects and left me feeling like a zombie someone suggested essential oils. Bingo! It didn't happen overnight but over the next couple months of trying different combinations my sleep cycle corrected itself. It had made a world of difference in my mind functioning. I don't think people realize how much long term sleep issues can impact your brain. Sorry about the long story but thought it's something really important to think about.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0426,"user_ideo":-0.4018,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":5},{"user_id":10154475540128024,"comment_id":10153486227004330,"date":"2015-08-08","message":"Aka...bait","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2834,"user_ideo":0.0068,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":6},{"user_id":509594192579983,"comment_id":10155075149528984,"date":"2017-01-04","message":"Jesus was not white you know.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1115,"user_ideo":-0.8534,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":7},{"user_id":348190378892960,"comment_id":10150758599009999,"date":"2016-02-28","message":"I have a beautiful piece of carpet that should be used for the walk...it is a charcoal midnight blue sold at $5,000 US currency a square inch.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2291,"user_ideo":0.0479,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":8},{"user_id":1164135976941328,"comment_id":10154003510241680,"date":"2016-11-15","message":"Major conflict of interest... security clearances are all on a need to know basis and they don't need nor do they KNOW SH_T","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3269,"user_ideo":-0.722,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":9},{"user_id":10157307901550424,"comment_id":1347339455301014,"date":"2016-11-18","message":"That dude from ancient aliens in his true form.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3557,"user_ideo":-0.4152,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":10},{"user_id":10154417488889834,"comment_id":10154367599793279,"date":"2016-08-08","message":"I do like her hairdo though.
