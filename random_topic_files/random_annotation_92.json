Secret Service is a MUST. Has anyone complained about gas prices since Bush left? Or did we just forget for the entire 2nd term- we paid over $4 and $5 per gallon? If you haven't taken a vacation that's your problem- Jim Rohn said it best about Americans- your salary is a reflection of your ability to contribute to society! But this is a conservative report- does anyone want to comment on how-much in billions- Bush signed over to his VP's companies? We don't talk about that- Stand up- you want anything in life- go and get it- Americans have the blueprint several times over and that's why we're the greatest country in the free world! Better get educated and understand that our government is not designed the way our history books have recorded it- we have way more issues to tackle than to worry about Camp David. Please- it's written into protocol the use of Air Force One and the Secret Service- but wait a minute- no one researches any of these facts of how to 'handle' the sitting President of the United States. Or that every living past President has detail still. Wanna look up how much that costs us tax payers? This is laughable and I needed a little rant today- You and only you- create your reality. Grow some courage and get the life you want. If you don't know who Jim Rohn is, I invite you to look him up.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0023,"user_ideo":-0.4203,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":227,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":92},{"user_id":1164190463695741,"comment_id":10154537206276323,"date":"2016-09-17","message":"You know what dreads mean, right?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0446,"user_ideo":-0.6883,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":136,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":92},{"user_id":10210354495477493,"comment_id":1040924905955102,"date":"2016-05-30","message":"Wow!!!
