You have *some* cops that act like they are above the law. Regardless if someone is a drug dealer or has priors, they do not deserve to die. That is not a decision that any cop or authority should make. We have a judicial system in place that does the deciding for us. Because of this, all cops get a bad rep. Think about the 2 innocent cops that died in ny a few months ago. For what? Because of the sterotypes that are created by the actions of the few. Meanwhile thousands of cops risk their lives everyday and no one focuses on that. Instead we publicize the ones that commited crimes. On the flip side you have a black man that dies. Regardless of his innocence he should not have died. Convicted for his track record? Yes. But not killed. After all these similar cases that have occured across our nation, you have an entire race scared and angry. Not that their anger is not justifiable. But looting and violent riots are not the solution. Just because the people looting are black doesnt mean they had a right to commit crimes themselves last night. You destroyed the businesses that serve you everyday. You destroyed the community you live in. And now what? Everyone is condemning you and making the entire black community look like violent people when that is so far from the truth. What about the peaceful protesters last night? We dramatize and publicize the violence because it is sensational. A group of black community members protesting the unfortunate death of a young man is not enough for the ratings. This is larger than one community. This is a nationwide issue. Not all cops or black Americans are bad! Reading the comments today and seeing so much hate against both sides is disgusting. How can the country progress and ever move away from the division when people are filled with so much hate? Hold the percentage of bad cops accountable. Stop glorifying people for looting saying it is necessary. It didnt change anything in ferguson. It wont change anything now.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0787,"user_ideo":-0.6384,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1395},{"user_id":1152668558128850,"comment_id":10153322560516509,"date":"2015-02-03","message":"$200 is too high,if house is payed off and taxes are probably $500 a year.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5656,"user_ideo":0.3027,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1395},{"user_id":1271941232818020,"comment_id":10153019201576336,"date":"2015-02-27","message":"This reminds of a murder in America six years ago where a newly elected President would not allow an investigation into the death of a investigator whose body discovered in a garbage dump.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.768,"user_ideo":0.4807,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1395},{"user_id":1061458437271670,"comment_id":906853472779240,"date":"2016-11-25","message":"What the hell is she going to accomplish.
