I went years with a sleep disorder and eventually went to a neurologist because I thought was having signs of dementia or something because my memory was horrible. After testing and MRI to rule out other possibilities she suggested I get my stress and sleep problems under control.After trying several things that had bad side effects and left me feeling like a zombie someone suggested essential oils. Bingo! It didn't happen overnight but over the next couple months of trying different combinations my sleep cycle corrected itself. It had made a world of difference in my mind functioning. I don't think people realize how much long term sleep issues can impact your brain.
