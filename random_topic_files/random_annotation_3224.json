It's about listening to music, watching TV, playing video games, and using social media. You can't complain about social media and then turn around and let your kid watch TV for 4 hours a night or play video games until it's bed time. None of this stuff is bad in moderation. My daughter plays Minecraft, listens to music, reads books, plays outside, and watches TV on top of being active in karate and now swimming. Before you knock on the habits of teens, take a look at yourself. My newsfeed is constantly full of people saying they binged watched 2 seasons of some show on Netflix.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.007,"user_ideo":-0.2862,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":5},{"user_id":10210293522117231,"comment_id":10152730097141656,"date":"2015-01-29","message":"Take the subway homie. $20 bucks cheaper.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1868,"user_ideo":-0.2621,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":6},{"user_id":10154531224520736,"comment_id":729523193819430,"date":"2015-07-24","message":"Mervyn, we might already be using too much water as it is, without considering the additional load of substituting the 684 million gallons of oil used each day in the US with water, let alone the rest of the world.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0207,"user_ideo":-0.4764,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":7},{"user_id":10210117848932309,"comment_id":1150319041751918,"date":"2017-01-22","message":"Destructive, put them in jail!

What ever happened to 2-source verification. Anything less equates to media bias and false representation. Mainly, the Liberal Media has failed to honestly critique Democratic candidates at least on an equal basis as they do Republican candidates. The Liberal media engages in character assassination and they are doing it to hundreds of decent people across this country who totally reject their political beliefs. Not only is the Liberal Media complacent in character assassination...they are aiding and abetting in it's conduct. Since I disdain everything they stand for, I expect them to continue on with their assaults on Republican candidates across the country. If people want to listen to an believe the trash they spout, then by all means do so. But the Democratic Party sucks...anyone that is one of them and engaged in character assassination sucks, and I for one will never vote for even one Democrat because of it. When they engage in character assassination using deceit and lies...that is what their subjects are voting for to represent them in our government.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.3647,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":19},{"user_id":306927159648451,"comment_id":1148054268548261,"date":"2016-06-01","message":"Waaaaaaa it is Hillary's fault coz i am such a loser. waaaaaaaaaaa everyone's fault but me.waaaaaaaaaaa","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0308,"user_ideo":-0.6985,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":20}]
