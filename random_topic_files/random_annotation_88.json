Over the progress of the impeachment trial,two episodes can define actually what is going on. First episode, one audio record was leaked involving 3 head senators (one of them was involved in Slavery accusation, that was archived later of course). They literally talked about rise up Temer as president, so would be more easily to put breaks on the Lava Jato operation (op that unleashed all the political crisis in the country). This week, days before the senate trial, there was another leak in the investigations, pointing one of the Minister of Supreme Court as another beneficiary from the Petrobras corruption scheme. Summing up, what is happening on Brasil is criminals fighting criminals for power. The Mainstream media keeps moving people around the two main groups: The 'Fora Dilma' supporters and the 'Fora Temer' supporters. Brasil Politics are shit, just like anywhere on the planet. The difference is that we now have a circus to watch.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0348,"user_ideo":-0.4756,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":14},{"user_id":10157302210050230,"comment_id":10154826738952383,"date":"2017-01-04","message":"\"\"\"\"Didn't authorize it...\"\"\"\" You are delusional.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1836,"user_ideo":-0.3557,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":15},{"user_id":10154416539419207,"comment_id":1035283406528804,"date":"2015-10-01","message":"Daniel Thoren-Cunningham","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0976,"user_ideo":-0.3345,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":16},{"user_id":10154305122507605,"comment_id":10154405265021243,"date":"2017-02-11","message":"I will!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3897,"user_ideo":-0.491,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":17},{"user_id":1044068352335874,"comment_id":10152945182386167,"date":"2015-05-30","message":"Never mind then .","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3607,"user_ideo":0.5566,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":18},{"user_id":1775545326068048,"comment_id":10153941023299087,"date":"2016-07-23","message":"We Now Have Further Evidence That The DNC Committed Fraud Against The Public By RIGGING The Democratic Primary For Hillary Clinton!

If you have not seen the emails there are thousands of them showing collusion with the media to promote Hillary and even plans to protect themselves from 'looking like' they were committing election fraud ie the actual primary elections and there are many lawsuits filed re the election fraud and voter suppression around the country in favor of Hillary Clinton. The American People Should Be PISSED OFF And DEMAND JUSTICE! Hilary will NEVER Become President and if the DNC has ANY sense, which obviously they don't have much... they will NOT nominate Hillary Clinton and instead Nominate Bernie Sanders who would have won without the election fraud and voter suppression and clearly would have done EVEN BETTER if the DNC has not committed Fraud against Him/US! #NeverHillary #NeverTrump If you don't nominate Bernie WE ARE GOING GREEN! Most people are planning to leave the party after this convention.... I do hope criminal charges are filed.
