So how nice of you to grace us with your uneducated answer. God is light and is only good the devil is darkness and causes disasters and bad things to happen. If God fixed everything all the time how would there ever be a good and an evil? How when miracles happen could we say it was God. I'm a grateful believer in Jesus Christ but I am also not stupid. This had nothing to do with God or the devil it had everything to do with three lunatics who used arson to burn down a wooded area that is surrounded by homes and businesses. God didn't make that choice for them. He can only send the angels to protect and watch over with his love and grace.....I know this was a horrible disaster but it could have been much much worse more people could have died the state could be covered in fire no just two little towns. These criminals set this spot on fire bc they knew it would get the attention of others it's a heavy populated area and they were obviously mad at someone or something to want to cause so much distraction. In fact they might even have been mad at God and the only reason someone would be mad at God is bc they don't know him and don't care to. I feel bad for them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9023,"user_ideo":0.2666,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":88},{"user_id":10205633148303030,"comment_id":10153767146503256,"date":"2015-11-24","message":"No shock there.

As an American hispanic, I'm tired of how all of these coward racist liberals that hate America like Obama, Clinton, and their supporters are trying to turn this great country into a 3rd world one. Unfortunately, one of the biggest problems we have right now is the media and entertainment that are always trying to tell us how to think. They have created enough imbeciles that would re-elect a failure like Obama. Even more, I'm supposed to bow down to anti-American Obama, love liberal policies no matter how destructive they are, love bigger enslaving government, and be in favor of illegal immigration because of the color of my skin... disgusting.

All of the next debates should be moderated by actual political scientists instead of all these corporate pimps with their carefully crafted questions. Who would be more friendly to the corporations Hillary or Bernie? It is quite obvious as to the agenda of these corporations that pander to those who will maintain their wealth and power in the halls of our government.
