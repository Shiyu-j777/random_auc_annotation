Nothing. No plans, no policies, no how to's, just hateful rhetoric and lies. Almost too many lies to count. Then there's that pesky sexual assault problem, with more victims coming forward each day. And those 3 rape charges and lawsuits against him. He's had over 4000 lawsuits filed against him over the past 40+ years. That's 100 suits a year. For someone who says that he doesn't settle, he's settled plenty of times, with the caveat that he hasn't admitted to any guilt. Then there's that other pesky problem he has with racism. Don't forget, Donald has that great relationship with \"\"\"\" the Blacks \"\"\"\". Donald's bad business practices date back more than 40 years. He's far from the panacea that people think he is. Most people that haven't lived in the NY tri-state area think that he's the greatest thing since sliced bread. He isn't. How many innocent people do you know that have been sued 169 times by the Federal Government for continual bad business practices and racial discrimination against blacks and other minorities? This dates back to 1973. And that's just on this one topic. So try again. He is a cold, calculating, cruel, manipulative, arrogant, egotistical, ignorant, whining, bullying, narcissistic pu$$y. This is not someone to be considered for the role of President.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0036,"user_ideo":-0.7282,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":88},{"user_id":10153881851293412,"comment_id":10150715227839999,"date":"2015-12-23","message":"Aw, shut your nail holes, Christers.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1171,"user_ideo":-0.6175,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":88},{"user_id":1146525438799791,"comment_id":10153286658471509,"date":"2015-01-21","message":"Isis eat pig","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9721,"user_ideo":-0.3788,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":121,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":88},{"user_id":10210077006503928,"comment_id":1430901653672749,"date":"2017-01-14","message":"why, because I don't support Steve Harvey?
