How about our LEO's and military that suffer from PTSD/depression? Do the permit holders get grandfathered in or do they have to be evaluated now? Or do their medical records just get looked at? Which then lead to the question of how many people would NOT talk to their doctor because rights would be withheld. There are already too many folks who aren't willing to fill out forms we have because \"\"\"\"the governments gonna watch them\"\"\"\". Who's going to check the medical records, Government or private companies? Will hippa laws have to be rewritten? I'm all for gun control, but this mental health issue is too big to resolve. It's not the way to go.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0859,"user_ideo":-0.2843,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":1},{"user_id":2024287714458746,"comment_id":10157915989000557,"date":"2016-12-23","message":"Kari","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0443,"user_ideo":-0.0901,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":2},{"user_id":219085925160271,"comment_id":10154241149086770,"date":"2017-02-19","message":"Are you that stupid?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5038,"user_ideo":-0.4172,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":3},{"user_id":1465061683509320,"comment_id":10153120342157452,"date":"2015-10-03","message":"PattyQuiroz for the guards","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1798,"user_ideo":-0.3181,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":4},{"user_id":923327767814111,"comment_id":10156159611640093,"date":"2015-09-21","message":"Signing, poor dolphins!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0959,"user_ideo":-0.7092,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":5},{"user_id":10155299037010016,"comment_id":10153952377209060,"date":"2016-02-13","message":"You are so ignorant","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3,"user_ideo":-0.2674,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":6},{"user_id":1158705124151629,"comment_id":1011716895549372,"date":"2016-04-26","message":"Seems to me Michelle is getting out of hand.

I've been married twice. First time was a mistake because we had nothing in common. Second time was a whirlwind and when it was good it was really good, but I found out way too late when I was most vulnerable that she had no intention of taking any responsibility for our marriage, but she had every intention of taking as much property and money as she could. And yes, I know, don't let my cynicism ruin anyone else's dream...I just think it's a good idea to be smart.
