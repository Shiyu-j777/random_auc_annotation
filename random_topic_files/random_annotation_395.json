Also, why is anyone even giving credencce to anything Trump is saying regarding this? He separated himself from the pageant or they separated from him.

Someone needs to emphasize to her that she did not, in fact, win anything. It was an unfortunate mistake so why should there be any sharing. I guess some folks believe that a person who is mistakenly given a crown should be rewarded for it...why???
