It's about listening to music, watching TV, playing video games, and using social media. You can't complain about social media and then turn around and let your kid watch TV for 4 hours a night or play video games until it's bed time. None of this stuff is bad in moderation. My daughter plays Minecraft, listens to music, reads books, plays outside, and watches TV on top of being active in karate and now swimming. Before you knock on the habits of teens, take a look at yourself. My newsfeed is constantly full of people saying they binged watched 2 seasons of some show on Netflix.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.007,"user_ideo":-0.2862,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":10},{"user_id":1176680272389377,"comment_id":719590404898204,"date":"2015-12-25","message":"great job guys","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8508,"user_ideo":0.8663,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":11},{"user_id":1191567940886229,"comment_id":10153913034602426,"date":"2016-08-20","message":", the Governor of Louisiana asked him NOT to come yet idiot","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2567,"user_ideo":-0.5239,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":12},{"user_id":10206988213611480,"comment_id":10154056692257391,"date":"2017-01-24","message":"God bless the new President and the United States of America","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9951,"user_ideo":0.8109,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":13},{"user_id":10209225623429670,"comment_id":10154092840441336,"date":"2016-02-28","message":"R u KIDDING me??.
