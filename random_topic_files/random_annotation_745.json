I feel like I spent the entire day today rushing from errand to errand and it's been that way for the past few days now. I did insist on one thing that's made a difference, especially for my little boy and youngest daughter who also participated. We conducted a food and clothing drive -- @Unity Group Sacramento's first community service project. The project benefited a local Christian ministry's homeless shelter. This project represented a small beginning of something we hope will become great! We need more likes on our page, if you don't mind visiting.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5164,"user_ideo":0.7351,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":745},{"user_id":947812232008609,"comment_id":1225847890782997,"date":"2016-06-17","message":"Praying","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9215,"user_ideo":0.2502,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":206,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":745},{"user_id":10154153085574902,"comment_id":1924141831141301,"date":"2016-11-09","message":"Let's go red...America must win tonight","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9935,"user_ideo":0.6807,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":745},{"user_id":10209657152286243,"comment_id":10153826083513067,"date":"2016-08-07","message":"you actually had to post it.. CNN even admitted its doing everything it can to help Clinton. CNN has 2 postings: 1. How bad Trump is doing and how far behind he is in the polls. Which no one can produce the actual poll. #2, How great Clintons campaign is doing and how far she is ahead in the polls. Again. does not produce the poll. And check CNN through out the day.. its the same format.. once you figured it out.
