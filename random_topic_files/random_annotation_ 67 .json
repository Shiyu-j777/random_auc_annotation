What I do see are children gunned down, normal every day people at movies gun down, Universities students gun down, Marines gun down, people in a church gun down. This is real life for us now. Not a TV show. We are in a sad state of affairs. It's not the Presidents fault. He has talked and talked upon every slaughter.
