You're unique because you take those news stories and facts and make sense of them. I think you're at your best when you tie things together. I really enjoyed The Root special you did, exposing what Russia is really up too. Mainsream media might gloss over a few details but they never put things together like you do. I appreciate that and have learned a lot over the years from you. So, I would like to see you continue to \"\"\"\"tie things together\"\"\"\" as it relates to daily events. I also enjoy your \"\"\"\"history\"\"\"\" shows. It helps me get a clearer picture of what's going on, and can learn from it. Personally, I learned a lot from your Root special. So much Russian history I didn't realize, but as you presented it, it made sense. Understanding the history of Russia makes all the difference in understanding what they're doing (their motivations & strategies). \"\"\"\"Founders Friday's\"\"\"\" we're great, would enjoy seeing them. Finally, I always enjoy audience and \"\"\"\"#AskGlenn\"\"\"\" shows. One reason being, we (\"\"\"\"the audience\"\"\"\") can ask questions of you. Maybe if we're confused on a topic, need further clarification or just have a question, we have the opportunity to ask. I hope this helps you? For me, I just like to learn, learn the reasons behind what is happening, see the proof or history to back it up and try to make sense of it all.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9991,"user_ideo":0.9387,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":227,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":810},{"user_id":10207394057595752,"comment_id":642049655985613,"date":"2015-08-20","message":"So now fox is liberal trash.
