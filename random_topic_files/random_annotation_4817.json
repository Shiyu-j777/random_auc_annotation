I do tend to look at people oddly when they drink cow's milk because I think it's disgusting. For those who don't look at others oddly when they drink cow's milk, their reasonings are likely because when we drink cow's milk, it's usually out of a cup, which comes from a carton/jug/bag. We don't generally see grown humans hanging off of a cow's udder when they want a drink.
