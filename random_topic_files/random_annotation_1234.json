That being said, even outside of situations of clear abuse, people who are severly depressed can be pushed over the edge by seemingly inocuous events because their minds simply cannot see the situation clearly, and almost everything can seem entirely hopeless. Again, if you have not been there, it can be extremely hard to understand or imagine.
