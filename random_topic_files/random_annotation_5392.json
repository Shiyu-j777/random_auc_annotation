I've been married twice. First time was a mistake because we had nothing in common. Second time was a whirlwind and when it was good it was really good, but I found out way too late when I was most vulnerable that she had no intention of taking any responsibility for our marriage, but she had every intention of taking as much property and money as she could. And yes, I know, don't let my cynicism ruin anyone else's dream...I just think it's a good idea to be smart. Though if you have to consider a prenup, you probably shouldn't be getting married anyway.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0524,"user_ideo":0.4959,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":1},{"user_id":1849987995229082,"comment_id":1136646169689071,"date":"2016-05-13","message":"These are Sanders supporters, sorry to burst your Bern bubble, you seem like nice people.
