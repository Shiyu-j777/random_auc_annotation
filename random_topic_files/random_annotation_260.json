If so, not only are you setting a bad example for your kids because you are cheating, but you are also putting your and your kids lives in danger. Tell me if the Patriots are guilty of doing this, why does the penalty have to be so severe, especially when other QBs, namely Aaron Rogers and Brad Johnson BOTH admitted to doctoring the footballs they used. Does that mean that the Super Bowls they won should be stripped from those teams? What is going on is the New York media hates the Patriots and to hype this infraction is a witch hunt to get all NY fans who hate the Pats to give them ratings.
