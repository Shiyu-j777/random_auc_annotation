If anything...between the force reductions, sustained ops tempo, ousting of an unprecedented # of senior leaders, softer/gentler training tactics, reduced training standards, conversion to civilian contractors in place of military bodies, our military is struggling. We might spend a lot of money, but the recent political oversight from congress and a president who have no clue how to run a military has severely weakened its ability. Less than 20% of congress has ever served, how would they know what's best for the military?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9887,"user_ideo":0.2682,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":6},{"user_id":1434167469930668,"comment_id":542685049225615,"date":"2016-03-11","message":"Use the biggest bomb we have and send a barber over to give that little pumpkin kid a decent haircut.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3812,"user_ideo":0.8692,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":7},{"user_id":1719866004932623,"comment_id":1214286418589434,"date":"2016-04-18","message":"Yes","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9446,"user_ideo":0.8551,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":8},{"user_id":402552186750839,"comment_id":10154575219929087,"date":"2017-02-15","message":"#lockhimup #exterminatetraitors","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0445,"user_ideo":0.0432,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":9},{"user_id":10153854811793063,"comment_id":10150744577189999,"date":"2016-02-11","message":"You were the ones who forcibly occupied a federal building, armed to the teeth, and now you're complaining about not getting a \"\"\"\"peaceful resolution\"\"\"\"?
