Woke up, as I usually do, at 2am to go to the bathroom and kept hearing a \"\"\"\"thump-thump-thump\"\"\"\", startlling me; turns out it was my left arm clanging on the wall, dead as a doornail. I was in the middle of having another stroke! Linda called my son who met us half way to the hospital and received treatment. However, i learned later to NEVER do that - call 911 instead. As soon as they arrive the EMT's begin treatment, forwarding vitals to the hospital, etc. and saves ER admittance time, also. Took 3 days before they'd let me out of bed to take a shower; they agreed I was ripe, lol~","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2261,"user_ideo":-0.6065,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":8},{"user_id":10208749342224593,"comment_id":10153911601541336,"date":"2015-12-16","message":"Amen","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6788,"user_ideo":0.7057,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":9},{"user_id":10154859393857453,"comment_id":10154113226244641,"date":"2016-05-05","message":"True stuff Rayan","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3036,"user_ideo":-0.5897,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":10},{"user_id":1105928942815933,"comment_id":10154096598483908,"date":"2016-04-15","message":"they show germans, the most tough soldiers of WWII. propaganda.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4688,"user_ideo":-0.0089,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":11},{"user_id":1085721688174675,"comment_id":10153563742159153,"date":"2015-08-27","message":"Thank you all!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3465,"user_ideo":-0.7132,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":12},{"user_id":1816717115232564,"comment_id":10153787466731350,"date":"2015-11-11","message":"Hats off to all of our police!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9533,"user_ideo":0.534,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":13},{"user_id":956983274427091,"comment_id":1248855788508349,"date":"2016-11-18","message":"Adorable. ..","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4922,"user_ideo":-0.4083,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":14},{"user_id":10208640880932925,"comment_id":10154864791272501,"date":"2016-05-25","message":"Wow...'jaw drop'.
