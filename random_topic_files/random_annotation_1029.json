I feel like I spent the entire day today rushing from errand to errand and it's been that way for the past few days now. I did insist on one thing that's made a difference, especially for my little boy and youngest daughter who also participated. We conducted a food and clothing drive -- @Unity Group Sacramento's first community service project. The project benefited a local Christian ministry's homeless shelter. This project represented a small beginning of something we hope will become great!
