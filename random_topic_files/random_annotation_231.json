If anything...between the force reductions, sustained ops tempo, ousting of an unprecedented # of senior leaders, softer/gentler training tactics, reduced training standards, conversion to civilian contractors in place of military bodies, our military is struggling. We might spend a lot of money, but the recent political oversight from congress and a president who have no clue how to run a military has severely weakened its ability. Less than 20% of congress has ever served, how would they know what's best for the military?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9887,"user_ideo":0.2682,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":9},{"user_id":10210983282964844,"comment_id":1056100797780398,"date":"2015-11-11","message":"Some information regarding Fukashima.
