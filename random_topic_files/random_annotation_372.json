I'm not even a Steve Harvey fan like, but I respect his journey. As far as what his wife did, what was it that she did? There have been plenty of God & Bad role models in my life whom aren't famous and they pass on tools it's up to the person receiving the tools to use and apply them to there life and self. I'm not here to convince you as a man to want to be better. However, there nothing wrong with someone wanting breakdown barriers and walls for others. Also, counseling is good for everyone single and married! As, for this group of Marjory all men my point still stands the same, and guess what Steve Harvey wasn't even my influence on my opinions it was my personal growth, my up bringing and environment and my willingness to want to be a better woman.
