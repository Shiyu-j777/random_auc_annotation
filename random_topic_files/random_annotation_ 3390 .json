Woke up, as I usually do, at 2am to go to the bathroom and kept hearing a \"\"\"\"thump-thump-thump\"\"\"\", startlling me; turns out it was my left arm clanging on the wall, dead as a doornail. I was in the middle of having another stroke! Linda called my son who met us half way to the hospital and received treatment. However, i learned later to NEVER do that - call 911 instead. As soon as they arrive the EMT's begin treatment, forwarding vitals to the hospital, etc. and saves ER admittance time, also. Took 3 days before they'd let me out of bed to take a shower; they agreed I was ripe, lol~","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2261,"user_ideo":-0.6065,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":2},{"user_id":285785505118214,"comment_id":10156924119845725,"date":"2016-04-13","message":"Nice, John...I just watched that video, that guy is the man!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4505,"user_ideo":0.5869,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":3},{"user_id":492344514307991,"comment_id":1352250248128661,"date":"2017-01-06","message":"Conspiracy theory from an unidentified source inside Cia.
