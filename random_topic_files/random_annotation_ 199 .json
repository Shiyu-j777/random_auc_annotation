They also save money by refusing to have a large enough staff on duty to watch the floor and deter shoplifting... Meaning that in some cities as many as two officers pretty much spend their days dealing with crimes at Walmart... and the taxpayers pay for those police officers... Meaning that once again we are subsidizing Walmart's cost of doing business. Also...
