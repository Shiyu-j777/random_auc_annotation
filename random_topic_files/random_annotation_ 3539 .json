We have real problems to deal with - like Homeland Security. Look what's happening in the world - ISIS is terrorizing every nation! Their racial issues are on them at this point. They haven't the facts to even back them up. They have blood on their hands! They should be arrested by the hundred at this point, not applauded or appeased. Here are some facts: An African-American Harvard Economist, Roland G. Frye, Jr., just published findings that there is no racial differences between the deadly shootings of whites and blacks by law enforcement in America. He began his study because he was angered by black men being shot by white cops. But his study surprisingly found that police officers use deadly force when they perceive a threat, regardless of skin color. This data undercuts the entire BLM's argument. He summarized by stating \"\"\"\"Yes, there are some instances of criminal acts, but they are far and in between,\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"they are not disproportionate by race.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9948,"user_ideo":0.7061,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":8},{"user_id":10153766223195823,"comment_id":1314404418579585,"date":"2016-02-25","message":"Lack of freedom is everywhere not only in South Korea","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2913,"user_ideo":-0.2377,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":9},{"user_id":10157352633200051,"comment_id":10153007444467483,"date":"2015-07-30","message":"Have you looked at the current administration?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.852,"user_ideo":0.2874,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":10},{"user_id":492344514307991,"comment_id":1352250248128661,"date":"2017-01-06","message":"Conspiracy theory from an unidentified source inside Cia.
