Aside from pre-Reagan crap that went down...some of the things he did were terrible. Iran-Contra? So what about Pres. BUSH Sitting like a DOPE and doing nothing for 9 min after twin towers hit. Iraq War fiasco and feeding false info and Intel to ALL Abu-Graib Halliburton FEMA and Hurricane Catrina And Pres. Bush waiting 4 days to send ships to NOLA after. Blackwater and NOLA The fact that Pres. Bush and Dick Chenney committed war crimes and also crimes against humanity by lying about the reasons for war. Maybe Democrats should remember the next time the GOP do something that is really reckless like ignore warnings and intell regarding an eminent terrorist attack given by the outgoing administration .
