Senator Cotton, do you really think Vice President Biden is going to waste his time 'debating' you, especially after what you've done? You should no longer be in the Senate. These 47 Republican legislators who wrote a letter to Iran are ignorant (don't they know the laws of the Constitution?), disrespectful (of a democratically and legally elected President), arrogant (in overstepping the authority of the President), racist (ready to do anything to destroy Barack Obama - remember Mitch McConnell's stmt, when B.O. first won the elections, that his first priority, instead of looking after the American ppl, would be to ensure B.O. would not get reelected), and the laughing stock of the world (even Iran had to lecture them about knowing their own laws). And, to make matters worse, this comes right after a similar act (that of brazenly inviting Netanyahu). Imagine if the Democrats had written a similar letter to Gorbachev during the Reagan administration and imagine the fury of the Republicans if that had happened. Disregarding the laws and the constitution of this country smacks of treason. What is happening to our Congress? That is not what our Founding Fathers worked for. I want these 47 pompous racists kicked out of our Congress! They no longer have my respect. And their continuing misbehavior (and this is a mild term for their act) is a threat to the democracy of this nation. Before anyone claims I am politically biased, the Democrats have never done something like this, ever.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0007,"user_ideo":-0.4409,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":733},{"user_id":285261701849077,"comment_id":1670044163216098,"date":"2016-08-16","message":"Hahahaha","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3757,"user_ideo":0.8677,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":121,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":733},{"user_id":1147891628601876,"comment_id":10154874082679330,"date":"2017-01-14","message":"Smart man Steve harvey","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9439,"user_ideo":-0.1199,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":733},{"user_id":10209643286017108,"comment_id":10154459355217144,"date":"2017-01-30","message":"Environmentalists are the greatest threat to GREED !","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0573,"user_ideo":-0.1653,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":733},{"user_id":1236476409705361,"comment_id":1679014792360601,"date":"2016-03-25","message":"Obama you Isis leading pos","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.5775,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":733},{"user_id":1114259215328855,"comment_id":10154111056732541,"date":"2017-01-14","message":", have you seen everything for yourself self on Google?
