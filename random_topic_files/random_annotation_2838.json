During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said. He added that accusations of incitement and the closure of media offices must not occur without due process. Haim Shibi, a member of the foreign relations committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of ¡°turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually portraying the IDF [Israeli army] as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills them.¡±","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0372,"user_ideo":-0.5781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":3},{"user_id":1091921847570278,"comment_id":10152720598506135,"date":"2015-04-22","message":"Hope these jobs are to fix their millions of recalls...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.269,"user_ideo":-0.3202,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":4},{"user_id":1085721688174675,"comment_id":10153563742159153,"date":"2015-08-27","message":"Thank you all!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3465,"user_ideo":-0.7132,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":5},{"user_id":10101672931738515,"comment_id":10153874221804740,"date":"2016-01-03","message":"Uh yeah just enough to support a conviction, including testimony from the defendants own family members about the poaching and arson.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0471,"user_ideo":0.2124,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":6},{"user_id":10205269465855719,"comment_id":10153684689066162,"date":"2015-09-02","message":"Tear-jerkingly enlightening!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.106,"user_ideo":0.0864,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":7},{"user_id":10210311912377961,"comment_id":10154616263621729,"date":"2016-04-29","message":"She made it through Ranger School without special treatment.
