I wonder if there is any study demonstrating that uniform rules do anything to combat bullying. What I know is that every now and then there is a news piece about a kid sent back home for failing to adhere to rules often interpreted ad lib and a host of cyber bullies ready to blame their parents for failing to understand the fine print of the school clothing mandates. It is troubling to me that everything the media seems to cover about the British educational system is apparel and hair style. And I find it peculiar that people tend to discuss whether the rules themselves are being properly applied instead of questioning their purpose and efficacy.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0021,"user_ideo":-0.5101,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":136,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":728},{"user_id":10210448203745445,"comment_id":10153357488476336,"date":"2015-06-14","message":"Because it's there? ;-)","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0876,"user_ideo":-0.787,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":728},{"user_id":10207450726614579,"comment_id":263598070738208,"date":"2017-02-14","message":"Perhaps this is a good time to remember why President Obama fired him!!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0143,"user_ideo":-0.8382,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":728},{"user_id":1739645266302790,"comment_id":10154135499643487,"date":"2016-03-30","message":"Weak!
