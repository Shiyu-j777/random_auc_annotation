You're completely right that bills can wait, however I don't put myself in financial situations. I'd rather use my degree, that I paid for & help sick people get better. What if someone was going into labor? What if someone was rushing to the hospital to spend the last minutes their loved ones have on earth? What if an ambulance got stuck in that traffic? What if a cop was trying to get to a call and stop a robbery?

The Jewish people have their holidays, and are able to take them off as legal holidays. In fact, when my kids were in school, their \"\"\"\"holiday\"\"\"\" play included Hanukkah and Kwanzaa and their REAL meanings, yet left out the true meaning of Christmas. They only correlated Christmas with Santa and Rudolph. You can go to the store and find things for those religions. But, this has been a primarily Judeau-Christian nation. The courts were decorated with The Ten Commandments and our dollars embellished with In God We Trust. What I do see is an all-out assault on Christianity and anything correlating to Christmas as a Christian holiday. Sad that there are people so offended by the birth of Jesus, the savior, but it was foretold that this would happen. Oh, and for the record, I wouldn't file a complaint if a teacher had a Kwanzaa decoration displayed or if Hindu had one displayed. It doesn't offend me that they choose to practice or celebrate their religion and holidays. My celebration shouldn't offend them.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9801,"user_ideo":0.5228,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":8},{"user_id":10154425217799770,"comment_id":10154068294658271,"date":"2016-08-27","message":"you are one of the idiots we are forced to live with.
