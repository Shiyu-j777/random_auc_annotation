Then they killed the gorilla. For absolutely no reason. None. Sad. Some humans believe their lives are worth more than other living beings. Sad. We aren't any better. This gorilla didn't need to die. What a loss. It's another reason why I hate caged animals. Although I support the breeding and resolution like the San Diego Zoo, this was uncalled for. You killed an innocent gorilla because a careless mother couldn't control her child.
