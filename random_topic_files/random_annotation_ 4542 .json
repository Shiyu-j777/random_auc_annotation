Get yourself a wedding photographer (not just any photographer, an actual wedding photographer!). It is after all, a once (or twice, or thrice for some?) in a lifetime event that you want to have amazing pictures of and while yes your family and friends will take photos and all, do you seriously want to leave it to chance? It is hard work, it takes skill, it takes education and practice. Save expenses somewhere else: invite a couple less people, get another venue, maybe even go for other flower arrangements, etc but definitely don't skimp on the photographer!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0106,"user_ideo":-0.6743,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":6},{"user_id":10210783743976174,"comment_id":10154766661221756,"date":"2016-09-15","message":"Catrina Kure","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0533,"user_ideo":-0.618,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":7},{"user_id":10208488515884561,"comment_id":10153273444858145,"date":"2015-08-02","message":"of Milford, died at age 23 on August 20, 2011. Richard Grossi, of Milford, died at age 55 on October 21, 2009. Joshua Fromer, of Lynn, died at age 19 on August 23, 2005. He was killed in a motorcycle crash with an illegal alien with prior violations. Scott Coxell, of Waltham, died at age 39 on November 23, 2011. He was run over in a crosswalk by a car that police believe was driven by an illegal alien unlicensed driver who fled the scene. She was charged, but later retracted her confession. Her boyfriend claimed responsibility, but escaped prosecution because authorities had no evidence that he was responsible. Sara Escudero, of Stoughton, died at age 64 on June 24, 2013. She was killed while driving to her job as a nurse by an illegal alien visa overstayer who was driving drunk and unlicensed after a night of partying. Ashton Cline-McMurray, of Boston, died at age 16 on October 13, 2000. He was killed by a group of Asian Tiny Rascals gang members, including at least one illegal alien from Cambodia, named Loeun Heng. After Cambodia refused to accept Heng for deportation and ICE had to release him six months later according to the terms of aSupreme Court ruling, the case brought national attention to the problem of court-ordered criminal alien releases, which now number in the thousands, including more than 100 convicted murderers like Heng.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9835,"user_ideo":0.7519,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":8},{"user_id":10208114931488982,"comment_id":10153583254706509,"date":"2015-04-21","message":"is breaking someone's neck while in handcuffs legal? you couldn't be more simple minded if you were forced to be.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0543,"user_ideo":-0.5956,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":9},{"user_id":1337058852995378,"comment_id":10154293399698822,"date":"2016-11-27","message":"Wow I see so many uneducated comments!!

The fine print being that 54% of our discretionary spending goes to defense, not 54% of the budget. This is intentionally misleading. Again, only 6% on education is also the section of discretionary spending that the military spending comes from. It's meant to mislead, not grant a more true-to-life picture of what the government spends on education vs. defense. The term government itself is misleading, since it obviously only refers to the Federal government. The entire governmental body (State, Federal, Local) spends more on education than on defense. The federal government budgeted to spend $119.2B on education in 2016. They budgeted $851.8B for defense. These numbers alone tell a much different picture than 54% vs. 6%. Additionally, the federal government budgeted $57.1B in government transfers to state and local bodies for educational spending. So the federal government in total have budgeted roughly $176.3B for education, ~4.4% of the total federal budget. This compares with 21.3% on defense. Where the major difference factors in are in the state and local levels, where most of the educational funding comes from, vs. nothing for defense (since defense is only allowed to be a federal and state expenditure). The state level of government budgeted $1B on defense nationwide. On education, they budgeted $284.2B for education. The local governments budgeted $0 for defense and $604.5B for education. A grand total of $852.8B was budgeted for defense, while a grand total of $950.8B has been budgeted for education. In summary, TOTAL GOVERNMENT involvement changes things drastically, with the budget for defense coming up to 13% of the budget, and education totaling 14.5% of the total budget.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4165,"user_ideo":0.0757,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":18},{"user_id":618164288347273,"comment_id":10154526077743541,"date":"2017-01-30","message":"A perfect spot to share my talented friend, Steve Eaton's great anti-Koch Brothers protest song!!
