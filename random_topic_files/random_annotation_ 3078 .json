Bush and GOP cronies on war crimes...meanwhile anytime a Democrat coughs the wrong way and the GOP calls for a special prosecutor and millions later Ken Star came up with nothing....8 Benghazi committees and nothing....now e-mails and nothing...no proof just speculation and same old foot political stomping. Aside from pre-Reagan crap that went down...some of the things he did were terrible. Iran-Contra? So what about Pres. BUSH Sitting like a DOPE and doing nothing for 9 min after twin towers hit. Iraq War fiasco and feeding false info and Intel to ALL Abu-Graib Halliburton FEMA and Hurricane Catrina And Pres. Bush waiting 4 days to send ships to NOLA after. Blackwater and NOLA The fact that Pres. Bush and Dick Chenney committed war crimes and also crimes against humanity by lying about the reasons for war. Maybe Democrats should remember the next time the GOP do something that is really reckless like ignore warnings and intell regarding an eminent terrorist attack given by the outgoing administration . Maybe we should speak up more on how GOP refused the funds to step up Benghazi and other embassy's security...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0014,"user_ideo":-0.6753,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":12},{"user_id":10154157729435813,"comment_id":10152970471654641,"date":"2015-01-21","message":"now thts more like it obama going HAM","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9792,"user_ideo":-0.3541,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":13},{"user_id":10210045915842896,"comment_id":10153301301342426,"date":"2015-11-18","message":"She did it Congrats","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4814,"user_ideo":-0.0619,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":14},{"user_id":1437057116328081,"comment_id":10153332145416615,"date":"2016-02-10","message":"so my kids choice is be inspiration porn or get kicked in the hallway?

They do illegal stuff all the time and if him and others on the force we're dealing in criminal activity and look by this picture he looks like a thug,never judge a person by the looks or what the media puts out,maybe he knew to much,is what I am saying maybe he was actually murdered. And what does me owning a gun have to do with me wondering if it were foul play? Is your family member on this police force or are you looking for a argument or a race comment? If not go back to school and learn what words mean because darling you just misinterpreted what I said all the down the line. I do not support criminals and I do not support cops being brutal and I sure as hell do not support people trying to make good cops look bad,and I do not support arguing over bs and arguing over something someone read all wrong.
