Hicklen Just so you are informed by actual sources and not memes and image searches on Google, I will give you some actual places to check your facts. *Shows that the national debt, right now is almost $20 trillion!! In 2008, it was $10 trillion. So yeah, no improvement. *The unemployment rate in October was 4.9%, and in February of 2008, guess what? It was 4.9%...no change, maybe hope, but no change. *The Dow Jones in 2008 was around 14484.66, in October it was 18142.42....so not that huge, really. I mean....sure the number of insured Americans has gone up, because Obama put laws in place to penalize them for NOT getting insured. Families this next year will have their \"\"\"\"Affordable\"\"\"\" Obamacare premiums rise to over 40% in some areas. Had you ever heard of ISIS in 2008?? Hmmmm...neither had I. So let's get this straight...you've been misled and uniformed. You can't get your news from google image search or Facebook. You have to do the research. No Trump supporter is \"\"\"\"scared out their minds\"\"\"\" because \"\"\"\"they elected a nazi nationalist to the presidency.\"\"\"\" ONLY Dems are because they chose to believe everything that CNN, MSNBC, ABC, NBC, and CBS told them...even though there is factual proof that Hillary holds many of their reporters in her pockets. So we researched, did our own homework, and realized the lies that were being told. The idea that Trump supporters \"\"\"\"don't like liberals or open boarders, minorities or Muslims\"\"\"\" is absurd being that exit polls showed that Hispanics, Muslims, and Blacks did indeed vote for Trump. And you do realize, that it's racist to claim that the \"\"\"\"Majority of Trump supporters were white, so they voted Trump to keep America white again. So sad\"\"\"\" I voted for Trump because I had two choices, someone who was energized about trying to help America, and willing to bring in ten tons of help from every walk of life to guide him...or HIllary, who continuously lied to her own supporters, about her health and about her legal battles. If the Dems had had another candidate, who knows? But Hillary wasn't a strong candidate, she just wasn't. She wasn't transparent, at all....didn't allow that many interviews and didn't even rally as much. Between August and October, Trump had 87 rallies, Hillary only had 34. At one point, she took off FIFTY SEVEN DAYS in a row....how much did she truly care about winning?? I say all of this to say, I don't know you...I sure wouldn't judge you, and all I ask, is that you don't judge me either. We both had our reasons for voting who we voted for, and while I did research, it appears you relied on Facebook memes, and that's okay. No judgement. But what we need to do now, is try and attempt to find some common ground, somewhere, and start putting this nation back together. If Hillary would've won, I would've prayed for her, for her protection, for her guidance, for her to succeed....she would've been my President. As an American, for anyone to hope that the nation's leaders fail, is like hoping the pilot of your plane fails...it just doesn't make sense. Maybe it's time for us to drop what can't and won't be changed, and just pray that our nation will be okay, regardless of what our personal feelings are. I hope you have an amazing Thanksgiving. Take care, and may God bless you!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9993,"user_ideo":0.6077,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":889},{"user_id":10154722288351294,"comment_id":10154702755219497,"date":"2016-10-07","message":"this is why I want a cool Leather jacket","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1495,"user_ideo":-0.7786,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":889},{"user_id":10207042698455788,"comment_id":10154048652863128,"date":"2016-02-20","message":"Absolutely to be admired , I give her a lot of credit","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7732,"user_ideo":0.0149,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":95,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":889},{"user_id":10208498070402659,"comment_id":1086815844692220,"date":"2015-07-25","message":"He didn't call her out, cause he was taping her, thank God!
