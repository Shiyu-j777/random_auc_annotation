The demand for manual labor in the \"\"\"\"new\"\"\"\" world that was being stolen from its rightful owners created this demand and created a huge market for slaves. It is very unlikely that without this demand there would have been much less abductions among Africans for that purpose.

But yes my default setting for why America is so disliked by so many and why American lives are endangered are the influences of 1 AIPAC and Israel and idiot evangelicals (Cruz&Rubio voters etc),2 Neo Cons as you say and 3 politicians financed by the U.S. arms industry. These three overlap each other greatly to the extent of almost being indistinguishable from each other.
