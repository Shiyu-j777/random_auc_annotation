Here is an excerpt from the most recent MO Driver's Guide which states that on public streets and highways cyclists and motorists \"\"\"\"have the same rights and responsibilities as a motor vehicle\"\"\"\" Which means cyclists have a right to be on the road but also have a responsibility to obey the traffic laws. As a cyclist or motorist I certainly do not claim perfection but try to show mutual respect no matter which role I am in. Some things you should know when sharing the road with mopeds or bicycles: â€¢ Most collisions with bicycles and mopeds happen at intersections, where smaller, slower bicycles and mopeds are especially easy to overlook. Scan carefully for bicycles and mopeds before proceeding through an intersection, giving them the same consideration you would any other vehicle. â€¢ Bicycles are often overlooked by motorists. â€¢ It is not always easy to judge the speed or distance of a bicycle. â€¢ Crashes with wrong-way bicyclists frequently occur when a motorist wants to turn right onto a main road and is only looking left for approaching traffic. Be sure to look right and check for wrong-way bicyclists on the road or sidewalk before proceeding. â€¢ On residential streets, especially those with parked cars, travel at or below the speed limit. 59 SHARING THE ROAD WITH MOPEDS AND BICYCLES 60 â€¢ If you are following a bicyclist and need to make a right turn, slow down and remain behind the cyclist until you are able to turn. â€¢ Cyclists often travel at surprisingly fast speeds. If you need to make a left turn, yield to oncoming bicyclists unless you are absolutely sure you can make the turn before the cyclist reaches the intersection. â€¢ Bicyclists change speed and lane position when encountering bad road conditions, such as manhole covers, diagonal railroad tracks, drain grates, road debris, or in strong winds. Be ready to react. â€¢ When you are passing, give bicycles and mopeds a full lane width. Do not squeeze past these road users. The bicycle is generally a slower moving vehicle and this may require you to slow down. Wait for a clear stretch of road before passing a cyclist in a lane too narrow to share. â€¢ Check for passing bicyclists before opening your car door into a traffic lane or bicycle lane. â€¢ A bicycle lane is a portion of a roadway designated by striping to be used by bicycles. You may cross a bicycle lane when turning or when entering or leaving the roadway. You must yield to bicyclists in a bicycle lane. WHERE TO RIDE MOPEDS AND BICYCLES On public streets and highways, you have the same rights and responsibilities as a motor vehicle operator. Always ride with traffic, never against it. When operating at less than the posted speed or traffic flow, generally ride as near to the right side of the roadway as is safe. The right edge of the road often has hazards like ditches, gutters, sand, and gravel shoulders. Leave space between yourself and these hazards as needed for safety.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1384,"user_ideo":0.5305,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":164,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":747},{"user_id":1072388892827777,"comment_id":908913712485203,"date":"2015-04-09","message":"hes a taxpayer and its his yard!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7159,"user_ideo":0.3007,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":210,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":747},{"user_id":10100818855381102,"comment_id":10154184881442300,"date":"2016-04-30","message":"Shut up you idiot","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7746,"user_ideo":0.6046,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":747},{"user_id":1143050302405218,"comment_id":10153048799571336,"date":"2015-03-10","message":"An angel at work.

If anything the lack of anger (and name) for Meursault's victim said something not only about the 'absurd' of life but about the social values of Algiers at that time. His whole philosophy was seeing the beauty of life and the absurd injustice of it. He was a humanitarian and a fighter for freedom. 'The Plague' being a perfect example. I haven't read this book by Mr. Daoud, so I can't say what his feeling about Mr. Camus is (it seems he enjoys his material given the basis of this novel) but the article sure comes across as pointing the injustice finger at Camus, which is absurd.
