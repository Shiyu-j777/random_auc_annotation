But instead of fighting governments to supply pads and tampons as a human right for women, she is fighting the pads and tampons themselves? The solution is not to go to the lowest denominator in hygiene, but to elevate those with less access by speading awareness for women's needs and making it a basic right. That's the bigger fight. Getting male-dominated governments to acknowledge this female basic need for hygiene.. not the other way around!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0011,"user_ideo":-0.3916,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":2},{"user_id":1431711666887061,"comment_id":10154537998823984,"date":"2016-07-23","message":"This is great.

I went years with a sleep disorder and eventually went to a neurologist because I thought was having signs of dementia or something because my memory was horrible. After testing and MRI to rule out other possibilities she suggested I get my stress and sleep problems under control.After trying several things that had bad side effects and left me feeling like a zombie someone suggested essential oils. Bingo! It didn't happen overnight but over the next couple months of trying different combinations my sleep cycle corrected itself. It had made a world of difference in my mind functioning. I don't think people realize how much long term sleep issues can impact your brain. Sorry about the long story but thought it's something really important to think about.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0426,"user_ideo":-0.4018,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":6},{"user_id":10154367939448769,"comment_id":419662828193673,"date":"2015-03-20","message":"Nah man, I never had a chance to rape any of them but you do get a medal for every baby you smoke","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2632,"user_ideo":-0.1785,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":7},{"user_id":10207267837683362,"comment_id":10154203461166378,"date":"2016-12-06","message":"A lot of people going to hell on this page.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3359,"user_ideo":0.6063,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":8},{"user_id":10209552692790614,"comment_id":10154112840818010,"date":"2016-03-22","message":"280 ppl actually responded that's a step ahead","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4632,"user_ideo":-0.2177,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":9},{"user_id":1250755494949215,"comment_id":1125867537500425,"date":"2016-10-28","message":"ðŸŒðŸŒðŸŒðŸŒawesome!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1239,"user_ideo":0.6511,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":10},{"user_id":10210121021561340,"comment_id":10153262412616756,"date":"2015-02-22","message":"As a human and as a union man, I am glad that an agreement has been reached.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0145,"user_ideo":-0.8414,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":11},{"user_id":10154474011714903,"comment_id":10154062918933279,"date":"2016-04-13","message":"I really really hope people don't just go by the headline here and listen to both the question and the answer.
