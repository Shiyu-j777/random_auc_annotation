I'm not a magical elf wizard but Skyrim was still worth 300 hours. You don't play a game watching a character, you are the character. You are automatically represented simply by playing. Most RPG's for the last 10 years have had character creations anyway, this false equivalency nonsense needs to stop gamers don't care and it detracts from what actually matters; exceptional story telling, excellent art direction and most important of all FUN.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0179,"user_ideo":-0.4536,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":20}]
