However, not all apples are equal. Sure would be nice to know the carrots came from land that wasn't full of residual pesticides. That the burgers weren't pink slime, that the lettuce hadn't been sprayed with poison and the milk was actually healthy. I don't think vending machines belong in public schools, but if they are water and both chewy and crunchy nutrition bars should be the only options. That should be a district choice though. The PE and playground time is another issue important to our children's health.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0777,"user_ideo":0.7526,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":3},{"user_id":1053965257990229,"comment_id":10153937281891028,"date":"2016-08-04","message":"Steven Voorhees Myers That's what crossed my mind too.

With our guns are more important than people lives!!!! Does not matter what the age or where the massacre. Guns and the push of the NRA rally every time. Other civilized countries can and do have better laws on gun control. I'm not a paranoid person who sees shadows and someone coming for them at every turn. What I do see are children gunned down, normal every day people at movies gun down, Universities students gun down, Marines gun down, people in a church gun down. This is real life for us now. Not a TV show. We are in a sad state of affairs. It's not the Presidents fault. He has talked and talked upon every slaughter.
