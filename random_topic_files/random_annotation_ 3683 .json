Propping it up as a exclusively Jewish artifact because it's in Hebrew (as if Palestinian history can't include the Jewish history of Palestine) is as absurd as the denigration of Arabic as a non-Jewish language, when in fact some of the great works of Jewish philosophy and poetry are in Arabic.

Second-- if that store is MAKING MONEY they also won't close a store. How many walmarts across this nation are dry and they still make money. (Let me answer that for you HUNDREDS.)
