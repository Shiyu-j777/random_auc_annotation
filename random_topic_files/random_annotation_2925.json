It's about listening to music, watching TV, playing video games, and using social media. You can't complain about social media and then turn around and let your kid watch TV for 4 hours a night or play video games until it's bed time. None of this stuff is bad in moderation. My daughter plays Minecraft, listens to music, reads books, plays outside, and watches TV on top of being active in karate and now swimming. Before you knock on the habits of teens, take a look at yourself.
