CIA AND OBAMA CIA chief Brennan is a Muslim. He opted to take the oath on a copy of the U.S. Constitution, not on the Bible as every past CIA director, Christian and Jewish, had done. Both Obama and Brennan were shocked by the unexpected victory of Trump and they have now planned to attribute Trump's victory to Russian hacking. The New York Times commented that ¡°in the 67 years since the C.I.A. was founded, few presidents have had as close a bond with their intelligence chiefs as Mr. Obama has forged with Mr. Brennan. So this hoax of Russian hacking is a planned strategy of Obama and Brennen to mislead the public about Trump¡¯s victory.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9907,"user_ideo":-0.1935,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":9},{"user_id":692114277632997,"comment_id":1834945866762198,"date":"2016-11-10","message":"Thanks trump SUPPORTERS for showing your true color","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1061,"user_ideo":-0.3036,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":10},{"user_id":10208019276778920,"comment_id":10153598121699342,"date":"2016-01-17","message":"they've done more by 7:30 a.m. than I'll probably do all day.
