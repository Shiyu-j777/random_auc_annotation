This is such a misleading article. I'm not even into games, but find this highly offensive from an accurate truth point of view. I do hope the title is meant to be read as a sign of hope, people pay that money because they probably want to see the game be made. How can you expect a fully functional game of that size before putting in considerable amounts of money? Just think of the latest GTA with a 1/4 of a billion funding.
