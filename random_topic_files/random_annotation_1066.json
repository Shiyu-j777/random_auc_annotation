He is POTUS and you can pout about that and whine about that but he is still going to be POTUS. We fought hard against the TPP because it was a horrible bill that both Hillary Clinton and Obama tried desperately to shove down the throats of American workers. Like Bernie i am thrilled that legislation is dead. No more TPP. You would have had TPP shoved down your throats uncaring about whether you lost your jobs or not if Obama had his way and Clinton had her way. No, I did not vote for or support Donald Trump but I give him credit and thanks for killing the TPP I also think Bernie cannot expect Donald Trump to do everything right away when he just got elected. Give the man credit where it is due. Also, Bernie knows that the Republican Party wanted the TPP passed for corporate America along with Clinton and Obama. So another thing to be thankful for is that Trump did as Trump will do due to his ego, he is not allowing the Republicans to run the show and make choices for him. He is doing what I knew and others knew that Trump would do...he is making his on decisions. I don't agree with Trump signing an anti-abortion law as he did today. That is very harmful to women and I know as well as others know that Trump did it as a favor to the Religious Right ( more like the Religious Wrong) for helping him get elected. We are going to have to fight that. As I said, don't be so hate filled and petty as to not allow yourselves the good in this TPP decision just because you did not get the person elected that you wanted to win. That is just being petty. Give the man, Trump credit for the good he did the American workers and we will see where he goes from here. It may even be a bonus to all of us that Trump is a man of his own, had a huge ego, and likes to call the shots his self. That ego of his might keep the Republican Congress at bay when they learn he is not going to let them push him around. Might even save our Social Security.
