And that's all I was really trying to ask. You and I both watched Clinton and Trump speeches without media bias and simply came to different conclusions. You and I both, as well as plenty of other Americans, put in the research to lead us to choose who we voted for as president. I was hoping for more actually related to his business and Trump News than Clinton coming up again. Trump is the president elect so I was wondering about him. Maybe you assume I'm tugging at some strings or something, but I was just looking for more on the business aspect.

Funny. Not only is the choice of venue to capture cowardly, they are taking children into the building so they can hide behind them! Such brave men! But language matters! You need to use the proper term for these people. They are domestic treasonous terrorists. They are not a peaceful assembly of protest- those don't involve carrying weapons- and they are not a militia. A militia is a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. It is not separatists taking up arms against the lawful government. Taking up arms against the government is treason. So these people are not only terrorists, but are committing treason. Every person over the age of 18 who enters that building needs to be held acountable for their treasonous acts. Every adult or adults who take a minor into that building need to be declared unfit parents and lose parental rights for extreme child endangerment.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0045,"user_ideo":-0.4819,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":15},{"user_id":1540053679354407,"comment_id":10153450616998984,"date":"2015-06-01","message":"Bs","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8155,"user_ideo":0.3375,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":16},{"user_id":1086706494747190,"comment_id":10153221120471336,"date":"2015-05-02","message":"Racism is spawned by a successful race wanting to keep dreggs from ruining their success.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8257,"user_ideo":0.5288,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":17},{"user_id":10153864587361158,"comment_id":10154104966152217,"date":"2016-11-17","message":"Fat pigðŸ˜","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5665,"user_ideo":0.1299,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":18},{"user_id":10154043978268285,"comment_id":1219994328079101,"date":"2016-08-14","message":"yes 10 points in general election ......you know we vote via electrol college.
