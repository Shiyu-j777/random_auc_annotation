I do tend to look at people oddly when they drink cow's milk because I think it's disgusting. For those who don't look at others oddly when they drink cow's milk, their reasonings are likely because when we drink cow's milk, it's usually out of a cup, which comes from a carton/jug/bag. We don't generally see grown humans hanging off of a cow's udder when they want a drink. That would be weird.. and we would look at them oddly.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0205,"user_ideo":-0.5775,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":9},{"user_id":1174551912566957,"comment_id":1168572489857057,"date":"2016-11-18","message":"Glad \"\"\"\"santa\"\"\"\" told her the truth!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4534,"user_ideo":0.8148,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":10},{"user_id":626943424140480,"comment_id":1129141320440211,"date":"2015-06-10","message":"Reality is that which can be observed by the 5 senses...Not your 5 senses, the 5 senses.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1739,"user_ideo":-0.3903,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":11},{"user_id":1664665130520189,"comment_id":925298310904864,"date":"2016-11-23","message":"Another racist blaming white people","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9942,"user_ideo":0.6341,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":12},{"user_id":569004143286476,"comment_id":10153558081329205,"date":"2016-04-08","message":"I don't trust Hillary.
