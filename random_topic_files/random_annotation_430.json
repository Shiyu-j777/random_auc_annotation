I totally get the learning about all cultures and religions and as many put it I am a \"\"\"\"liberal\"\"\"\" but even i see the wrong in this action. They could have chosen any phrase or word for calligraphy both arabic and persian have beautiful calligraphy writings that does not have such deep religious meaning. I can mostly relate to the parent for being spooked about the whole issue. I wouldn't threaten the school staff and get all crazy about it though. I am not religious but I would be weirded out if a teacher teaches my kid something so religious without explaining the meaning or trying to understand the effect of it on others.. wrong move on teachers part for sure.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0069,"user_ideo":-0.5047,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10210135107600133,"comment_id":10152697727962293,"date":"2015-01-12","message":"Wahhhh nobody is supporting terrorism wahhhhb","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5507,"user_ideo":-0.4849,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10154443814073166,"comment_id":10153649585861600,"date":"2015-09-10","message":"Shes still funny she will find another gig","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8018,"user_ideo":0.3343,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":102,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10154390683723627,"comment_id":1172354399509761,"date":"2016-06-09","message":"Even after endorsing Trump, many Republicans are finding themselves constantly forced to distance themselves from Trump's inflammatory statements. Saying they disagree is beginning to sound hollow so Republicans have taken another tack. They promise that the courts and Congress will safeguard the United States from Trump's authoritarian whims. If the New York businessman begins carrying out an agenda from the White House that looks anything like the one he's proposed on the campaign trailâ€“ like a ban on Muslims â€“Republicans promise the Constitution guarantees there will be a check and a balance. In other words, Republicans are saying their nominee is so awful that they need to reassure fearful Americans that they will â€œstep inâ€ to contain him, should he ever become President. As Fox notes, Mitch McConnell, John McCain and top Republican strategists have all echoed this point during the last few days, apparently operating under the delusion that a Party that has accomplished absolutely nothing legislatively during the past eight years could somehow be counted on to take on an aberrant and malevolent Executive Branch. Thatâ€s not only pathetic, itâ€s sick, as many were quick to point out: \"\"\"\"One might think that if you are suggesting that the country is strong enough to constrain a potentially authoritarian leader, it might be a good idea not to elect that potentially authoritarian leader in the first place,\"\"\"\"","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0015,"user_ideo":-0.8516,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":88,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10205802710381637,"comment_id":1166705363369934,"date":"2015-11-21","message":"Hear...Hear Ms. Ward...<3 <3 <3","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1302,"user_ideo":-0.8056,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10210835400500312,"comment_id":10154957869333627,"date":"2017-01-30","message":"YÃ aaaaaaaaawwwwwwnnnn","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5556,"user_ideo":0.2564,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":100,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10154643316059587,"comment_id":10154422153601509,"date":"2016-01-29","message":"This is ebola all over again","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3691,"user_ideo":-0.4905,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10205659286120625,"comment_id":10153076640486323,"date":"2015-02-08","message":"hey america! u spposidely freed iraqa from brutality, now whats going on there, what do u call this, were this isis was there befor, do u have any degnity to answer. what the hell u have made of a peaceful country iraq. shame on u america","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1492,"user_ideo":-0.4591,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":121,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10209733735847369,"comment_id":513344395519057,"date":"2016-04-27","message":"Such a great story!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3133,"user_ideo":0.2536,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":10202131465884365,"comment_id":10153768597878690,"date":"2015-10-02","message":"And how many more do you want to die in your so-called War on Terror?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0178,"user_ideo":-0.4647,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":430},{"user_id":1219026948130790,"comment_id":10153199220866770,"date":"2015-12-24","message":"Your lives are disrupted by you not taking care of your own business.

Fast forward to after the birth (at 3 am) and I was recovering well, baby was in NICU and fine, and her shift ended and a new nurse took over. The new nurse may have dressed well and \"\"\"\"looked classy\"\"\"\" but she was awful. She had the audacity to want to wake up my exhausted husband because he fell asleep wearing the OR scrubs and she didn't want him stealing them. WHAT THE HECK?! Seriously?! I almost died, my husband could have very well lost both baby and I and she's concerned that he didn't take off the scrubs before he fell into a comatose sleep? She sucked. I'll take tattoos and a sweet disposition any day over a high end snob.
