It must be much harder for them to serve because they are seeing what violence and injustice does. I'm not complaining about the Corps, I'm just saying they have a different world view. And distrust for the government has increased. After all there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq after all. Nothing in Afghanistan can ever truly be won. 9/11 happened somehow while we're out involved in something on at least every continent... Just feel bad for millenials going through this whole women in combat roles transition. Old Corps grunts and anyone with a CAR will fight it to the death. The Corps is trying to recruit millenials but there's a price to pay. Stress cards, womens empowerment, LGTBQ friendly, transgender friendly. It's a new world my friends. Maybe it's a step in a better direction.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0347,"user_ideo":-0.2735,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":874},{"user_id":10153896643623651,"comment_id":754688004680850,"date":"2017-01-20","message":"Dallas here","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8891,"user_ideo":0.745,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":227,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":874},{"user_id":651616904989941,"comment_id":10153689349158256,"date":"2015-10-11","message":"Hey Nat: as much as you run, were you in this ?
