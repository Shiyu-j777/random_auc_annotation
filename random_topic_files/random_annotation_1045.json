The English were broke and exhausted by the war but wanted to protect their shipping route to their colony India. This was before oil entered the picture. The Zionists convinced Balfour and England that if England created a new country for them that they would serve as England's strongman in the Middle East and do the bulk of the fighting that needed to be done. For Oil America joined later destroying Iran's Democratic government and partnered with England in funding the recently created nation of Israel and their military maneuvers. Israel has become Americas most expensive Military base. The \"\"\"\"Balfour Declaration\"\"\"\" was the official beginning of the forming of the country we now call Israel. Israel became a recognized country by the UN in 1948. Sadly the oil companies who toppled Iran's Democracy and worse do not want peace in the Middle East as it would kill their profits. If the people of the Middle East got a fair deal for their oil it would take money out of the pockets of the oil companies. I know it's disturbing but Israel is a pawn in the never ending exploitation of Middle Eastern resources. If it didn't serve England's military desires England never would have created Isreal. Obviously it is difficult to discuss such an inflammatory part of ongoing history where so many innocent people have died. The true horror comes from the oil companies not the People of Israel, but the Oil companies do use Israel to their own ends and Israel gets lots of funding for their trouble.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.004,"user_ideo":-0.7727,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1045},{"user_id":1019515881478026,"comment_id":10155327234886509,"date":"2016-09-19","message":"We do, you don't seeing as how you are from Panama.
