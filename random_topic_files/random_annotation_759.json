More presidential than Washington and Lincoln and both Roosevelts and Reagan all rolled into one. And since women make better decisions than men it is right to vote for Hillary just because she is a woman. And any one who says she is unqualified because she let those men die in Benghazi or because she ran a slush fund funded by foreign governments or because she took bribes from wall street just doesn't know what they are talking about. BTW Hillary is protected with men carrying AR15s, but you and I aren't worth it, and that's OK. That's why we should change the constitution to ban all guns, especially police guns. That way no one will get shot. You know just like we did with drugs. And I am shocked by the Washington Post saying that Hillary got 4 pinocchios and is still lying about her email. Washington Post is clearly biased for Donald Trump, which is why I thank god for MSNBC and The Rachel Maddow Show. And HRC had to make sure that Bernie didn't win for the good of the party. We all know that the party elites know things we don't know and don't need to know. That is why Bernie couldn't be the nominee, and all good jihadis, like Mr. Kahn, support Hillary. Oh that and the $375k Khan got from the Clinton foundation I am sure helps a lot. And have you noticed that an air of peace has descended over this country and the whole world now that FBI decided she wasn't a total crook.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0208,"user_ideo":0.4923,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":759},{"user_id":10209947016902640,"comment_id":984367701611884,"date":"2016-03-16","message":"Drew William interesting","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0561,"user_ideo":-0.3651,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":5,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":759},{"user_id":10201748930600998,"comment_id":724542967702302,"date":"2016-10-05","message":"He did What Millions of Americans would love to do SHUT DOWN TRUMP AND PENCE LIES AND HATE!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0017,"user_ideo":-0.4425,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":759},{"user_id":10206678949404889,"comment_id":1168430306588907,"date":"2017-01-16","message":"Lewis had nothing to do with the timing of investigations established due to Russian interference and the Trump association.
