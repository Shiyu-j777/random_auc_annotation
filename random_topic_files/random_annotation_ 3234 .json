Bush and GOP cronies on war crimes...meanwhile anytime a Democrat coughs the wrong way and the GOP calls for a special prosecutor and millions later Ken Star came up with nothing....8 Benghazi committees and nothing....now e-mails and nothing...no proof just speculation and same old foot political stomping. Aside from pre-Reagan crap that went down...some of the things he did were terrible. Iran-Contra? So what about Pres. BUSH Sitting like a DOPE and doing nothing for 9 min after twin towers hit. Iraq War fiasco and feeding false info and Intel to ALL Abu-Graib Halliburton FEMA and Hurricane Catrina And Pres. Bush waiting 4 days to send ships to NOLA after. Blackwater and NOLA The fact that Pres. Bush and Dick Chenney committed war crimes and also crimes against humanity by lying about the reasons for war. Maybe Democrats should remember the next time the GOP do something that is really reckless like ignore warnings and intell regarding an eminent terrorist attack given by the outgoing administration . Maybe we should speak up more on how GOP refused the funds to step up Benghazi and other embassy's security...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0014,"user_ideo":-0.6753,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":4},{"user_id":10206226123601538,"comment_id":10153837205691756,"date":"2015-09-18","message":"Beautiful story made me cry.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3936,"user_ideo":-0.5957,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":5},{"user_id":1022225031208097,"comment_id":735055443351700,"date":"2016-01-23","message":"Because he was so busy patting himself on the back for how well the economy was doing, get it!

Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so.
