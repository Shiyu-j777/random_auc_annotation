To rig a national election, to suppress American voters then get caught red handed, have the DNC head resign in disgrace, and within hours get hired by the Clinton campaign. This is the largest scandal in American history plain and simple. Well the Democratic party doubled down on what I consider a unelectable candidate none the less. It is my opinion that Hillary Clinton can not beat Donald Trump in election and rightfully so after shitting on our democracy. So with that say goodbye to democracy, to liberty and to the great nation we once knew. No self respecting person can vote for Hillary Clinton with the amount of fraud and scandals linked to her entire campaign. I'm not a religious man... but God save us all from these two presidential candidates. I am truly frightened and furious at the prospect of one of these two being elected president.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0092,"user_ideo":-0.4987,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":41},{"user_id":10206689371232340,"comment_id":10154198235753797,"date":"2015-10-26","message":"What a horrible way to die!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4292,"user_ideo":-0.2988,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":164,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":41},{"user_id":317836451891139,"comment_id":1157080454388205,"date":"2016-04-05","message":"10208064899913345, She can't win with only 67% support from registered Democrats, and almost zero crossover support from Independents and Republicans.
