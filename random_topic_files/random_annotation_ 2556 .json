I believe criminal charges are in order. We do have a class action suit already filed and this will guarantee us that we win that! If you have not seen the emails there are thousands of them showing collusion with the media to promote Hillary and even plans to protect themselves from 'looking like' they were committing election fraud ie the actual primary elections and there are many lawsuits filed re the election fraud and voter suppression around the country in favor of Hillary Clinton. The American People Should Be PISSED OFF And DEMAND JUSTICE! Hilary will NEVER Become President and if the DNC has ANY sense, which obviously they don't have much... they will NOT nominate Hillary Clinton and instead Nominate Bernie Sanders who would have won without the election fraud and voter suppression and clearly would have done EVEN BETTER if the DNC has not committed Fraud against Him/US! #NeverHillary #NeverTrump If you don't nominate Bernie WE ARE GOING GREEN! Most people are planning to leave the party after this convention.... I do hope criminal charges are filed. DNC is considered a 'private company' and as such holding a national contest and then rigging it for one particular winner is illegal....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":-0.3512,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":17},{"user_id":1661978680710220,"comment_id":10153668018151336,"date":"2015-09-11","message":"Condolences and prayers for his family!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6691,"user_ideo":0.8538,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":18},{"user_id":1159277334138724,"comment_id":10153834032661162,"date":"2015-11-04","message":"So you don't have to read the article he staged his suicide because he was going to get caught for stealing money and wanted his family to recieved his pension.
