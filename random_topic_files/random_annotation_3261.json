Get yourself a wedding photographer (not just any photographer, an actual wedding photographer!).

It is hard work, it takes skill, it takes education and practice. Save expenses somewhere else: invite a couple less people, get another venue, maybe even go for other flower arrangements, etc but definitely don't skimp on the photographer!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0106,"user_ideo":-0.6743,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":2},{"user_id":10202246947211474,"comment_id":10153144730704170,"date":"2015-02-20","message":"He must feel powerful.
