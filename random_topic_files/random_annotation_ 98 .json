During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said. He added that accusations of incitement and the closure of media offices must not occur without due process. Haim Shibi, a member of the foreign relations committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of ¡°turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually portraying the IDF [Israeli army] as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills them.¡±","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0372,"user_ideo":-0.5781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":5},{"user_id":10205180455870898,"comment_id":10153486270842014,"date":"2016-05-03","message":"Wow congrats","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3869,"user_ideo":-0.6101,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":6},{"user_id":10207033246572554,"comment_id":1423502861002796,"date":"2016-12-18","message":"Grace reveals herself","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.176,"user_ideo":0.0425,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":7},{"user_id":10157201434245510,"comment_id":10155112493922178,"date":"2016-07-13","message":"Socialism at its finest!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9856,"user_ideo":0.7216,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":8},{"user_id":426672701044491,"comment_id":10154143025588984,"date":"2016-03-04","message":"Absolutely","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8967,"user_ideo":0.5211,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":9},{"user_id":10157236124330293,"comment_id":10150615367354999,"date":"2015-06-30","message":"BERNIE SANDERS 2016!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0011,"user_ideo":-0.4091,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":10},{"user_id":1754552018161420,"comment_id":1134275653279572,"date":"2015-10-01","message":"Sick that people like to make another suffer for entertainment.
