I have two teenage boys (a sr and a freshman in a CCPS HS) all kids are different. My oldest loves getting up early and prefers the 7am shift at work. My youngest he likes to stay up late so he wants to sleep in. But on school nights he is good about going to bed by a certain time b/c he knows if he doesn't he is who suffers the next day. (and takes more after me I must say as I am not a early bird - but I know I have to be at work by 8:15 the next morning so staying up is not an option if I don't want to be tired the next day) It is all about being a parent rather than your child's friend! Problem with today's youth - they are not taught accountability or responsibility at all. Between this and the no zero policies kids today will never survive college or work deadlines b/c they are not taught a deadline is a deadline and if the work isn't done then you pay the consequence with a low or failing grade.
