You're completely right that bills can wait, however I don't put myself in financial situations. I'd rather use my degree, that I paid for & help sick people get better.

What if a cop was trying to get to a call and stop a robbery? This world runs by people doing their job, not by sitting in traffic that was cause by a non-emergency!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2929,"user_ideo":-0.0926,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":1},{"user_id":10209981239238186,"comment_id":10153331595862452,"date":"2016-02-03","message":"I almost bought a 2005 scion X b and glad I didn't.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1921,"user_ideo":-0.352,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":2},{"user_id":1797309713817473,"comment_id":834583456646736,"date":"2016-03-28","message":"the world should stop all trade with Japan, until they stop murdering beautiful animals, everybody else is trying to save. so sad, I can hardly bear it","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2294,"user_ideo":-0.6026,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":3},{"user_id":10207175444856016,"comment_id":970806476290026,"date":"2015-09-08","message":"NIck, one of the stone monuments that was erected, dating back to 750 bc, is taller than the empire state building.
