By law you must have insurance and registration on your car. But phone Apps, not a chance. Wait till the databases of collected mobile phone numbers get compiled from hacking to spam you with this crap - and then threaten you with it. The virus threat is huge and of course the ultimate - RansomWare, threaten you with bad reviews unless you pay up. This folks, is just the beginning of the end of smart phone freedom. And then the far right will really want to monitor your smart phone. Afterall, if Yelp can track you, why can't the gvt? Many Regulations and legal monitoring of phones is only when it suits extreme views (left or right). And this isn't going to be just an American problem, but global.Organized crime gangs and hackers will have a field day. Those spam txt messages you receive (cuz you probably posted your mobile number on Facebook) is already in the millions of txt per day. With Yelp, it will jump to 100 million per day. And wait until the company gets hacked. Game over.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0053,"user_ideo":-0.23,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":2},{"user_id":10207137648702389,"comment_id":10152991021501973,"date":"2015-06-12","message":"So glad we defeated our meth problem by making sudafed illegal......worth it","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.134,"user_ideo":0.6822,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":3},{"user_id":10208735589480210,"comment_id":10158038819550206,"date":"2016-08-03","message":"This sounds like a potential RICO charge.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.347,"user_ideo":0.3699,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":4},{"user_id":10207066231989446,"comment_id":10154318763087098,"date":"2016-12-26","message":"IT's a reflection from a window.

Propping it up as a exclusively Jewish artifact because it's in Hebrew (as if Palestinian history can't include the Jewish history of Palestine) is as absurd as the denigration of Arabic as a non-Jewish language, when in fact some of the great works of Jewish philosophy and poetry are in Arabic. To draw nationalist, sectarian lines around complex, multifaceted cultural products ignores the deep connections of all peoples in the region.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0009,"user_ideo":-0.6187,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":6},{"user_id":1634351830212391,"comment_id":1149229805155554,"date":"2016-05-04","message":"Arrest him or take away his Sec service detail and see how long he lasts","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9631,"user_ideo":0.8446,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":7},{"user_id":1661978680710220,"comment_id":10153668018151336,"date":"2015-09-11","message":"Condolences and prayers for his family!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6691,"user_ideo":0.8538,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":8},{"user_id":868294146609591,"comment_id":1211262755558400,"date":"2016-03-12","message":"Every time someone blames Zionist for the world's problems another nazi get their death head pin.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4687,"user_ideo":-0.6833,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":9},{"user_id":549806331871424,"comment_id":1383032408386212,"date":"2017-01-30","message":"Good for her","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7859,"user_ideo":0.1344,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":10},{"user_id":631914056973737,"comment_id":10157498774165500,"date":"2016-09-22","message":"If they had a job they would be in bed!!
