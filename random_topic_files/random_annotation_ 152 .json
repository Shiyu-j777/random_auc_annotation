And that's all I was really trying to ask. You and I both watched Clinton and Trump speeches without media bias and simply came to different conclusions. You and I both, as well as plenty of other Americans, put in the research to lead us to choose who we voted for as president. I was hoping for more actually related to his business and Trump News than Clinton coming up again. Trump is the president elect so I was wondering about him. Maybe you assume I'm tugging at some strings or something, but I was just looking for more on the business aspect. Thanks though.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5052,"user_ideo":-0.4809,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":6},{"user_id":10209904311505660,"comment_id":1038261799544493,"date":"2016-01-04","message":"Then he will understand when Americans come to HIS neighborhood as his homies did in Ferguson....","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9767,"user_ideo":0.8684,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":7},{"user_id":10211970072037744,"comment_id":1076688032351552,"date":"2016-02-14","message":"For one I can hardly vote on any american policy as I am not a citizen of the states. Nor I have agreed with their foreign policy. Nor are the States the pillar and only example of democracy. Your argument is that because there is no direct democracy, a totalitarian dictatorship is a better choice? Again why are you here? In these capitalist evil world we are living in. There is a better one, you just need to buy a ticket, the good state of NK will take care of the rest. Just go to the custom office and say you hate America and the western capitalist pigs and you are set.
