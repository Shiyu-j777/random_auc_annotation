First of all- Walmart doesn't close a store because of a rumor (this is not responsible news reporting so lets make this news source know that). Second-- if that store is MAKING MONEY they also won't close a store. How many walmarts across this nation are dry and they still make money. (Let me answer that for you HUNDREDS.) So before you start bashing a retailer that brings more revenue and jobs than most other retailers in that community id say you are a bunch of ungrateful residence.
