I've had terrible haircuts because the stylist didn't have the knowledge to cut my funky asian hair and didn't inform me of that. Unfortunately not all salon schools or hair stylists learn to cut all types of hair. If she was being racist I'm sorry. Personally i wouldn't want to support her business because either she's racist or needs more training.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0298,"user_ideo":-0.6398,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":6},{"user_id":10210194954252310,"comment_id":1126349874047999,"date":"2015-04-18","message":"It's not..............","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4892,"user_ideo":-0.8381,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":7},{"user_id":1669371363383528,"comment_id":10155193003997316,"date":"2016-07-15","message":"what could the possible goal of making this information so casually public be?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1155,"user_ideo":-0.5698,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":8},{"user_id":1251060254964765,"comment_id":1120525207977531,"date":"2015-07-29","message":"Governor Christie had the flags lowered in New Jersey, get ur facts straight ..","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4325,"user_ideo":0.0348,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":9},{"user_id":10153772562886114,"comment_id":10154850417195586,"date":"2017-01-27","message":"Happens with every new president the title was misleading so maybe u should read because there is nothing out of the ordinary here","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4195,"user_ideo":0.5198,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":10},{"user_id":1178749288846166,"comment_id":974816075908871,"date":"2015-06-19","message":"Imho pointing out problems wakes people to the reality and might trigger a consciousness shift","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.014,"user_ideo":-0.3404,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":11},{"user_id":10209114324448759,"comment_id":10158319091890500,"date":"2017-02-17","message":"Very beautiful","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6775,"user_ideo":-0.1055,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":12},{"user_id":1680125702311655,"comment_id":10153659991583145,"date":"2016-02-11","message":"That's wonderful I hope they have a wonderful wonderful time.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7256,"user_ideo":0.0468,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":13},{"user_id":10154400196688516,"comment_id":10154140412181323,"date":"2016-04-27","message":"Ummm no thanks!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3121,"user_ideo":-0.4147,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":14},{"user_id":845128045618009,"comment_id":1366476370039382,"date":"2017-01-20","message":"The truth hurt!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7394,"user_ideo":-0.2012,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":15},{"user_id":10157310697825057,"comment_id":10154603024769705,"date":"2016-11-08","message":"Trump and his supporters want the freedom to do what Singapore already has the freedom to do - give its own citizens \"\"\"\"priority\"\"\"\", discriminate against permanent residents and foreigners in education, housing, medical care, scholarships, jobs, etc. My favorite \"\"\"\"line\"\"\"\": \"\"\"\"Treating permanent residents and foreigners equally with Singaporeans is discrimination against Singaporeans!!\"\"\"\" Even undocumented immigrants in American have more rights than legal foreign residents in Singapore - such as access to public schooling.
