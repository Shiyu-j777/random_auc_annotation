I'll post a picture of the scumbag thief everyday from now on. How to fight back? Don't allow these savages to bully those who value secularism. It's hilarious that muslims become violently offended when a picture of their charlatan prophet is drawn as they simultaneously pass out propaganda that depicts jews just like the Nazis used to do. Let's not even go into the anti west propaganda they teach at schools! Yet, we westerners have to let them do whatever the hell they want to do when they immigrate to our countries?
