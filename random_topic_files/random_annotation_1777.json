Over the progress of the impeachment trial,two episodes can define actually what is going on. First episode, one audio record was leaked involving 3 head senators (one of them was involved in Slavery accusation, that was archived later of course). They literally talked about rise up Temer as president, so would be more easily to put breaks on the Lava Jato operation (op that unleashed all the political crisis in the country). This week, days before the senate trial, there was another leak in the investigations, pointing one of the Minister of Supreme Court as another beneficiary from the Petrobras corruption scheme. Summing up, what is happening on Brasil is criminals fighting criminals for power. The Mainstream media keeps moving people around the two main groups: The 'Fora Dilma' supporters and the 'Fora Temer' supporters. Brasil Politics are shit, just like anywhere on the planet. The difference is that we now have a circus to watch.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0348,"user_ideo":-0.4756,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":14},{"user_id":10211729638063414,"comment_id":1809457589323190,"date":"2016-11-19","message":"A missing box of ballots that'll turn this election around.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3232,"user_ideo":-0.6142,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":15},{"user_id":1039259509455384,"comment_id":10154425074838124,"date":"2016-12-15","message":"THATS NOT THE SAME THING","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4032,"user_ideo":-0.5354,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":16},{"user_id":631914056973737,"comment_id":10157498774165500,"date":"2016-09-22","message":"If they had a job they would be in bed!!

Upon determining the extent of his participation thru this investigation will determine if charges apply. Either way, the ethics of his oath were broken by his own statements regarding this situation that he so proudly shared on video. Supporters of his actions would not be so quick to support his personal beliefs if they conflicted with their own. As Sheriff, his personal beliefs must be set aside in pursuit of rule of law. Put the shoe on the other foot and contemplate if someday his OPINION on a matter led him to arrest someone based on his OPINION rather than law. This would be fascist.
