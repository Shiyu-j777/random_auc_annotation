His JOB dictates he follows laws as written. While he did not violate a specific law he enabled others, encouraged others and offered comfort and aid to obvious law breakers thru his office as Sheriff. Upon determining the extent of his participation thru this investigation will determine if charges apply. Either way, the ethics of his oath were broken by his own statements regarding this situation that he so proudly shared on video. Supporters of his actions would not be so quick to support his personal beliefs if they conflicted with their own. As Sheriff, his personal beliefs must be set aside in pursuit of rule of law. Put the shoe on the other foot and contemplate if someday his OPINION on a matter led him to arrest someone based on his OPINION rather than law. This would be fascist. Something we must guard against as a nation with rule of law.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0363,"user_ideo":-0.4904,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":11},{"user_id":1761421280794675,"comment_id":10153047404031336,"date":"2015-03-10","message":"Earned the record!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4172,"user_ideo":0.7086,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":12},{"user_id":1071265779594510,"comment_id":10153992099506782,"date":"2016-12-27","message":"So if someone reportedly did something, that would mean that your not 100% sure, but yet you post it anyways","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3838,"user_ideo":0.1802,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":13},{"user_id":10154229433612891,"comment_id":10154385666464497,"date":"2016-06-22","message":"Weird...
