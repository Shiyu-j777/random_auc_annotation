I don't have children in the public school systems in any counties I own properties (which happen to be 3 different counties in Michigan). Second, we have always carried our own weight...worked...paid taxes....paid for health care and health insurance....put our children through school (some private school years while paying tax into the public school system). Not once have we ever had a handout, ever. When my husband got laid of, he drove a cab instead of taking unemployment, and I got a full time job. So, if you want to support someone else, feel free to write them a check.
