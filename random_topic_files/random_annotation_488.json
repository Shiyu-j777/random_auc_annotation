Because they were so busy bowing to money, they ignored the recommendations of the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and allowed this in. Another example of the ignorance and arrogance of the GOP they put these crack pots in charge of the committees as a joke to make sure nothing ever got out of committee. Another example of republican leadership, 7 city's under republican control that have poison/tainted water issues now. 11 schools under republican control, not in Flint, that have had to shutdown and isolate the water in the schools due to water contamination.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0014,"user_ideo":-0.766,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":488},{"user_id":1212665718785462,"comment_id":791451140993321,"date":"2016-11-23","message":"I uncle Joe","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7058,"user_ideo":-0.4336,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":488},{"user_id":10209845627079028,"comment_id":1761831004089649,"date":"2016-07-21","message":"What an adventure!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1998,"user_ideo":0.4052,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":488},{"user_id":1145334548874915,"comment_id":1586551081648017,"date":"2016-08-26","message":"And we are worried about killing innocents.
