By giving transgender kids their own bathroom puts them in a spotlight and tells them and everyone around them that they aren't normal. This would put a target on their back. Most transgender kids who are out enough to want to use the bathroom of the gender they identify have probably been through years of therapy and possibly been living as that gender for years. They probably dress like said gender and may be on hormone blockers. There wouldn't be anything awkward about it, especially in a bathroom where there are STALLS. No one would even notice. I've used the men's bathroom for over 3 years now, and guess what, no one even looks twice. This is not an issue.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0109,"user_ideo":-0.6271,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":7},{"user_id":1243126332386043,"comment_id":10154384963809586,"date":"2016-07-21","message":"These people are scum of the earth and should not be breathing Earth's air.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.614,"user_ideo":-0.5083,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":7},{"user_id":1763507713888541,"comment_id":10152936264428525,"date":"2015-05-23","message":"Ive been down that road when i was young.not that extreme.shes taken the first step of asking for help.Hopefully shes willing to do whatever it takes to getting better.Is not just a matter of her starting to eat again.It probably runs deeper than that.Anyway prayers your way.one day one hour at a time.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8417,"user_ideo":0.0732,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":102,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":7},{"user_id":1657661087887611,"comment_id":10154139305279062,"date":"2015-07-19","message":"Talk about motivation!
