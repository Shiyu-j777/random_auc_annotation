It's not the guns that do the shooting it's the mentally ill or confused people who pull the trigger. After guns there are other things, bow and arrows, sledge hammers, box cutters, axes, saws, knives, crowbars, feet and hands, ropes, and etc. It's time to admit that some folks through no fault of their own have mental health and psychological problems. We need tougher mental health screening. What good does it do to ban guns when we all know that the criminals will always find a way to get a gun while the responsible people will be unable to defend themselves. The first line of our defense is ourselves. The 2nd amendment was written so that we could defend ourselves from governments just like the one that we the people are suffering under as well as those individuals that are intent upon causing grave harm to others.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9704,"user_ideo":0.7836,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":16},{"user_id":1271368796207469,"comment_id":10155401202106509,"date":"2016-10-04","message":"William Torres Jr. Eddy Herrera Albert Pineda Alejandro Montalvan Perez","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1522,"user_ideo":-0.7487,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":17},{"user_id":1274491922560835,"comment_id":10153396054704342,"date":"2015-10-03","message":"I was wondering how long it would take to hear that.... you're the winner!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2314,"user_ideo":0.813,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":18},{"user_id":1405892819425140,"comment_id":10153094685124440,"date":"2015-06-17","message":"ðŸŒðŸ ¼ðŸŒðŸ ¼ðŸŒðŸ ¼ðŸŒðŸ ¼ lets do it!!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.052,"user_ideo":-0.5095,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":19},{"user_id":10207999813017391,"comment_id":1010706362282450,"date":"2015-06-06","message":"They sent some Mariner hitters down to club the sea lions off of the dock.
