I'm not that religious and I in no way condone the actions of these terrorists but I know, coming from a muslim background, that drawing the prophet's face is sacrilegious. This may seem innocuous to non-muslims or people unfamiliar with the culture but it is very important in Islamic culture for a variety of reasons that I will not go into. I have friends/relatives who take it to the extreme and don't even put paintings of any faces in their houses/ allow their photos to be taken for similar reasons. The point is that, although the intent was probably good (and in fact noble, considering the trauma the journalists must have been put through), the lack of knowledge/understanding of Islamic culture means that the image is still deeply offensive. It's unfortunate really, because it is a big thing to forgive but the message is lost in the context.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0017,"user_ideo":-0.5062,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":17,"json_serial_number":641},{"user_id":301261680221488,"comment_id":10154444337020090,"date":"2016-10-20","message":"The trolls need to spend some time in Saudi Arabia.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5248,"user_ideo":0.1422,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":140,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":18,"json_serial_number":641},{"user_id":1005765229542871,"comment_id":10153483856316749,"date":"2015-11-20","message":"Article III, section 3 of the Constitution \"\"\"\"Any person who levies War against the United States or adheres to its enemies by giving them Aid and Comfort has committed treason within the meaning of the Constitution.
