Um...I believe those time schedules can be adjusted and make allowance for ships to not hit and kill a whale or two or a hundred. Maybe hire whale spotters during the migration months, or all year round, to spot and track whales and communicate with the incoming and outgoing ships the long and lat coordinates of the whales. Just an out there what if thought. The lack of decency and common sense of some individuals is appalling. Adjusting time schedules...Not rocket science.

The assumption and current scientific paradigm is that the human body functions as machines function, so modern medicine works in the same way mechanics work on a broken car. But, more and more, we are now finding out our bodies are more like depositories of millions and millions of ecosystems, individual, interdependent, complex and unknown.
