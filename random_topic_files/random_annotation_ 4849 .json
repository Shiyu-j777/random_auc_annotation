Richard Grossi, of Milford, died at age 55 on October 21, 2009. Joshua Fromer, of Lynn, died at age 19 on August 23, 2005. He was killed in a motorcycle crash with an illegal alien with prior violations. Scott Coxell, of Waltham, died at age 39 on November 23, 2011. He was run over in a crosswalk by a car that police believe was driven by an illegal alien unlicensed driver who fled the scene. She was charged, but later retracted her confession. Her boyfriend claimed responsibility, but escaped prosecution because authorities had no evidence that he was responsible. Sara Escudero, of Stoughton, died at age 64 on June 24, 2013. She was killed while driving to her job as a nurse by an illegal alien visa overstayer who was driving drunk and unlicensed after a night of partying. Ashton Cline-McMurray, of Boston, died at age 16 on October 13, 2000. He was killed by a group of Asian Tiny Rascals gang members, including at least one illegal alien from Cambodia, named Loeun Heng. After Cambodia refused to accept Heng for deportation and ICE had to release him six months later according to the terms of aSupreme Court ruling, the case brought national attention to the problem of court-ordered criminal alien releases, which now number in the thousands, including more than 100 convicted murderers like Heng.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9835,"user_ideo":0.7519,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":3},{"user_id":10201936285604965,"comment_id":713598115497433,"date":"2015-12-15","message":"He has been the best.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0318,"user_ideo":-0.4583,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":4},{"user_id":10154154896365589,"comment_id":1179828618703833,"date":"2015-08-26","message":"He looks like the news reporter from Parks and Rec.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2111,"user_ideo":-0.462,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":5},{"user_id":10209041692972229,"comment_id":10153753063814138,"date":"2015-11-30","message":"The people in that neighborhood are scared of the white supremacists randomly shooting at people.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.025,"user_ideo":-0.545,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":6},{"user_id":1724892324426704,"comment_id":10153560908258797,"date":"2015-01-05","message":"it really bothers me even more bcause I\"\"\"\"m a christmas bby how dare he its like takeing frm JESUS!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2806,"user_ideo":-0.3515,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":7},{"user_id":1289448961080327,"comment_id":10153367911102061,"date":"2016-01-28","message":"10157250257690181 Obama had two years with a congress that was democratic rule!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5628,"user_ideo":0.4314,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":8},{"user_id":10208375511603578,"comment_id":10153288734571756,"date":"2015-03-04","message":"I got my eczema cured by a psychologist.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0956,"user_ideo":-0.4612,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":9},{"user_id":10153706779546727,"comment_id":10153863687553721,"date":"2016-07-24","message":"Tanveer Mukthar","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0476,"user_ideo":-0.3609,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":10},{"user_id":10207153003839371,"comment_id":1035829113105098,"date":"2015-09-16","message":"Guess I'll have to get those solar cells and cut out the middlemen.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1541,"user_ideo":-0.5311,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":11},{"user_id":1751475788434250,"comment_id":10153177499686336,"date":"2015-04-20","message":"You are strong and that gives others hope!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3472,"user_ideo":0.7781,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":12},{"user_id":10210187930402521,"comment_id":984503564902730,"date":"2015-04-22","message":"This trend is out of hand.
