I use this space to talk about what happens in Brazil. The current President, Dilma Rousseff, taking advantage of her position, spreads in the international press that suffers a coup. IS NOT TRUE!!! The impeachment process by which Dilma says, is the result of years of misuse of public money. This process is accompanied by the Brazilian Supreme Court. Brazilians suffer from the current government. Corruption is totally out of control. Ms Rousseff purchase parliamentarians without any shame. The country's economy is in free fall. Crime is increasing. Killed more than 60,000 people a year in Brazil. Meanwhile, Rousseff Lady and her fellow squander public money on travel, luxury hotels, real estate, expensive electronics, imported cars and all that life has to offer. Place attached a more detailed text than mine. Better written than mine. Which explains how serious our situation. All I ask is that you read. Do not be deceived by foreign correspondents, which reproduce the speech of Ms. Rousseff. They lie. They have relationships with the Brazilian government. Thank you for attention. God bless you.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3406,"user_ideo":0.8622,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1321},{"user_id":10210473776749163,"comment_id":1765679040315920,"date":"2016-10-07","message":"^^^wow...racist much!
