Anytime you start paying people out of tax money collected from the public you end up with roo few dollars to spend on gvt.housing, medical Drs and supplies and food programs. This is all because the gvmt can't support the economy with tax.dollars that are dwindling due to low paying jobs. This is the program that Bernie Sanders wants.for the USA. THE CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY that we live in is supplying all these basic needs to most of the world.

Revelation 13:18 reads exactly what is below This calls for wisdom. Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666. Then the bible speaks of the beast having a head wound which Obama does. See Revelation 13:3 below â—„ Revelation 13:3 â–º One of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder and followed the beast. Obamas birthday is on 8/4 another fact. John 8:44 in the bible is specifically about the Antichrist. John 8:44 in the bible reads exactly what is below . You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies. Obama first got elected on 11/4/2008 Daniel 11:44 in the bible is about the antichrist But news from the east and the north shall trouble him; therefore he shall go out with great fury to destroy and annihilate many.
