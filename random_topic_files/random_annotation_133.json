They are competitive (10% acceptance rate), reviewed anonymously by other scientists and get this--no matter how much the award, scientists (who are professors with full time jobs already) get two to three months of prorated salary. This is while they do the research and manage the grant. The rest goes to university overhead (generally 50% for university operating costs) and actual lab equipment, stipends and tuition waivers for grad student researchers and travel to conferences. Scholars working for oil companies (who fund the 2% of scientists who claim global warming is a hoax) pay much higher than the barely six figure salary most public university full profs make.
