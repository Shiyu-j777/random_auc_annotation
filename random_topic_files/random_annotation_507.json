The investigation that Faherenthold launched into the Trump Foundation, along with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€s personal finances, has unearthed the fact that Donald Trump has used his charitable foundation, which is tax-exempt, as a tool to evade $2.3 million dollars of personal income taxes. How? By having business associates that owe him money to put it into his foundation instead. An excellent example is that the Trump Foundation took in payments â€œtotaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.â€ According to sources in the Trump organization who wish to remain anonymous the man is Richard Ebers, and he was told that instead of paying the former reality TV star for services, he should pay the Trump Foundation instead. It makes sense really, when you consider the fact that despite the reality that Donald Trump hasnâ€t even bothered donating to his own foundation since 2008 the â€œdonationsâ€ continue to pour in. One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trumpâ€s senior advisers, Boris Epshteyn, actually tried to explain it away by saying: â€˜What Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely â€œsuggestâ€ that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.â€","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.016,"user_ideo":-0.7941,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":507},{"user_id":320414694963038,"comment_id":10153747551802439,"date":"2015-09-23","message":"Oh dear God stop this evil in our world for the children's sake in Jesus name amen","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9713,"user_ideo":0.8687,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":507},{"user_id":306536923149645,"comment_id":962675410501237,"date":"2017-01-14","message":"you live in a cave you crazy","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.518,"user_ideo":0.041,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":247,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":507},{"user_id":10210306271755835,"comment_id":1131678940181099,"date":"2015-06-24","message":"PATHETIC!!!!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6995,"user_ideo":0.8906,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":140,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":507},{"user_id":10154306636392674,"comment_id":10153100801583690,"date":"2015-01-10","message":"Or it's ok to gun people down?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0303,"user_ideo":-0.551,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":507},{"user_id":10210553627226196,"comment_id":10154268284569411,"date":"2016-04-19","message":"please let's be serious.....It is no time to be a comedian here.We all have a clue about trolls.And we all have a clue about drunk Russian's that believe all of Putin's propaganda and lies.And most all of all Rory we all have a clue about Russia's corrupt government and of course the entire world knows what a murdering thug Putin is.Please Rory, do not tell us you are one of Putin's boy's toys.That would be very disappointing to us.What do you say Rory.Is it true?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0482,"user_ideo":0.5278,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":507},{"user_id":1048271671894601,"comment_id":1486791338005539,"date":"2016-12-08","message":"He is brainwashed.
