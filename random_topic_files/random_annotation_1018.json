Do states with more restrictive gun, ammunition bought, laws like California, have fewer mass shootings? Obama-did you notice? Guess not!Answer is-NO! We need GUNMAN control. It's NOW-has been, hard to buy guns in California, but that doesn't seem to have prevented this shooting. As it turns out, the two Muslims perpetrated this act of terror (the left and Farook's parents and lawyers-was hoping it was radical Christians going after the local Planned Parenthood-difference there being.. Planned Parenthood and other mass shooting-didn't have ties with an overseas radical religous ideological terrorist org-nor, pledged allegiance to any radical/extremist God or religion-now did they?. They were just plain nuts! The two shooters dropped their infant off before launching the massacreâ€”(yet the mother who was there didn't have a clue about their house/garge filled with ied's, bomb making material, guns, etc;) yeah right, this is a signature of Islamic fanatics. In no way-can a family NOT know, why did they lawyer up? Islam may not stand for violence-but there are those who will make it radical and extreme and violent. Name it.! What's scarier it seems the liberal msm and Obama and Loreeta Lynch-Attorney General are actually buying this. Don't profile, stereotype. Obama and Lynch WOULD sterotype if it were a Christian/Jewish, other religon other than Islam-quickly. Extremist Christians, Jews, Jehovah's Witness..etc; NO problem using those words in any other religion. Guess what? American peaceful/moderate Muslims i've talked to-WANT the President to name the distiction between them and RADICAL Islamist-it puts them in more danger when he does not!! Our President should be dedicated to defeating and calling it-what it is-- radical Islam. Maybe Obama should be telling us what \"\"\"\"common sense\"\"\"\" steps we can take to prevent the radicalization of Muslims in U.S.A.,, not taking away the means by which Americans protect themselves from radical Islam. Islamic group CAIR got in front of this immediately. They KNEW this was a Muslim terrorist operation! Obama-per usual-did his usual talking points of politicizing murder with this latest latest shooting events as did the Attorney General-and even FBI Director-(with Attorney General at his side),was made to tiptoed through their report. NO naming it for what it is-radical-say it Mr. President..RADICAL Islam! NOT naming it and being weak on that distinction makes radical terrorists feel that MORE empowered! Mass shootings are NOT unique to America, Mr. President.!!. When Obama was doing his chiding,scolding disinterested speech in Paris, a mass shooting conducted by Islamic State terrorists had just taken place, killing over 100 people, had just happened. Guess what? Paris/France have extremely tight gun control. OH!! OH!!! Ever notice a THEME that runs through Obama admin...and extreme left-when anything is criticized anywhere with them? It's someone else's fault-pass the buck and blame. After awhile-don't even the most loyal to Obama and liberals-realize that's becoming a very tired old record, playing again and again-and getting nowhere-no one believes it anymore. No one is going to elect a Democratic President who sits on their hands as far as illegal immigration,sudden HUGE influx of Syrian refugees coming here(that even the arab countries don't want!), more frequent radicalized Muslim attacks on our homeland-and your biggest fears are- climate change?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9994,"user_ideo":0.5268,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":20,"json_serial_number":1018}]
