Thinking he is dumb or naive. He ie a brilliant, Evil, spokes mouth. He has managed to distract everyone. While we've been busy complaining about his executive orders, Iran Deal, his divisive speeches regarding same sex marriage gun grabbing initiatives, Benghazi, Baltimore, Chicago. He has been flooding America with Criminals, releasing Ghitmo prisoners of war, releasing drug dealer from federal prisons with records of violent crimes, supporting sanctuary cities and building his own private military that answers only to him. He has replaced 5 Star Generals and other Military leaders with Military Nobody's, He has Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood personnel in THE WHITE HOUSE DAILY . The United States of America Is under Internal Attack and the only thing standing between these Enemies within are the CIA/FBI/ and major last line of defense who are planted throughout Government mainly the Military.

And yes, I know, don't let my cynicism ruin anyone else's dream...I just think it's a good idea to be smart.
