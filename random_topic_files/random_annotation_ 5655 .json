We have real problems to deal with - like Homeland Security. Look what's happening in the world - ISIS is terrorizing every nation! Their racial issues are on them at this point. They haven't the facts to even back them up. They have blood on their hands! They should be arrested by the hundred at this point, not applauded or appeased. Here are some facts: An African-American Harvard Economist, Roland G. Frye, Jr., just published findings that there is no racial differences between the deadly shootings of whites and blacks by law enforcement in America. He began his study because he was angered by black men being shot by white cops. But his study surprisingly found that police officers use deadly force when they perceive a threat, regardless of skin color. This data undercuts the entire BLM's argument. He summarized by stating \"\"\"\"Yes, there are some instances of criminal acts, but they are far and in between,\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"they are not disproportionate by race.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9948,"user_ideo":0.7061,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":5},{"user_id":5647744585,"comment_id":10153044513149586,"date":"2015-01-22","message":"Thank YOU for sharing this amazing experience with the world!

As a recent study conducted by the The Finnish Institute of International Affairs has demonstrated over the past few years, Russia has exerted considerable energy to influence European public opinion by using strategic deception that aims at altering of the target audienceâ€s perception of reality to secure strategic objectives. While Ukraine is still at the center of Russian propaganda efforts, issues such as the migrant crisis and the future of the European Union have been manipulated by Russian media to influence both domestic and foreign audiences. As pointed out by the NATO Strategic Communication Center of Excellence, Russian information warfare is not static. The strategies of Russian information war constantly change, and its tools vary from mainstream media to social network trolling. Studying and countering the Russian cyber troll army is a challenging task that has been undertaken not only by NATO research centers, but also by civil society activists in the Baltics. Governments face the question of whether to limit the diffusion of Russian state media.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0551,"user_ideo":-0.3609,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":10},{"user_id":10210660040433849,"comment_id":10157259869860294,"date":"2016-07-08","message":"Speaking of people who just want to see their name in a topic how bout you stop spewing hatred to something you don't get. Do you what it's like to be a public servant?! To go to work everyday hoping to God when they call 911 they actually need help and aren't setting you up. To work on an ambulance, completely unarmed I add, and knock on a door to help a total stranger. Or to be a police officer and answer a calm to defend or protect people you've never met? If you don't know what it's like to be a public servant, furthermore a police officer, shut up and stop telling them how to do there jobs. I am not saying their all perfect but then again no one is. So I'll reiterate my previous statement. If you have nothing more intelligent to say than \"\"\"\"that's what you get\"\"\"\" in support of a man who killed 5 cops who had NOTHING to do with previous cop vs civilian situations than shut your ignorant mouth and stop spewing senseless hatred. You talk about uniting, but then you spew moronic, counterproductive, and misplaced anger and hatred.
