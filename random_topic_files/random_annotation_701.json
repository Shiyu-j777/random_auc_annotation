Please play close attention what I'm going to tell you. I live in Wisconsin and the electric power company across the street from us now because they bought all the farm land that was once there. WEPCO, Wisconsin Electric Power Company was granted the right to expand. WEPCO is now the largest coal burning plant in Wisconsin. In 1999, they put a 3 to 4 story berm across the street from us stealing our wonderful scenery of 50 years. Why they did this I had no idea until they were granted the right to expand in 2007. Every bit of property here was farmland. It was like heaven here, so quiet you could hear weeds growing. Hang your clothes out to dry, lay outside take a nap. Total peace and quiet. Well after the expansion started we have been getting lied to and harassed daily through the phone or from the extremely loud exhaust. WEPCO has bought so much property around us and there are a few of us who don't want to move. Our house has been singled out with all the harassment. This corrupt company monitors, yes I know this sounds crazy, however they are monitoring where I am in the house and hitting me with extremely loud exhaust or loud engine braking. When this harassment all started they would not let me sleep because of the loud exhaust. I would get out of bed, any where from 12 midnight to 4 AM. because of the extremely loud exhaust. I would stay up until they quieted down and go back to bed. Within 5 minutes all the loud exhaust would start up again. I did have earplugs in. The exhaust was so loud earplugs didn't help like the Caledonia police didn't help. I have witnesses that live closer to the power plant that can verify this. This extreme harassment went on for years. I've emailed the police for 3 years almost daily and they are no help. BTW that was their reason to put the berm so close to our house. All the noise is amplified. Take a ride some day in the car and ride close to a building with the window down and you can hear everything. Like if your car was making a noise and you weren't sure what it was. People can walk across the street and have a conversation and I can hear them talking. Now almost ever car driving by has altered loud exhaust. None of this before the expansion. The police are owned by WEPCO. My father and mother built this house in 1960 my father passed away and my mother does not want to move. I am taking all the hits with the harassment. WEPCO is using GANG STALKING tactics. On certain days now the air smells like a foundry, never before. You can't hang clothes outside anymore. I am 57 now, I lived here since I was 5 years old and I love it so does my mom. This company has done so much trying to drive us out of here, they want our property and want to hide their DIRTY operations. I don't ever want to give them this peace of property because of how they are. The project manager for WEPCO threatened me by saying , You will be moving. I said no we aren't, he repeated, Yes you are. All the neighbors I talked to hate that guy. There were so many things they have done to us I am on 5-7 prescription pills because of them. Can you please check in on this corrupt company. Help me please anyway you can. Getting rid of the berm would be a nice start. I know you already have a handful Mr. President, but please see what you can do for me if you can. Thank you . I think what you started out with when you first got in office you did a good job. Your hands were filled with the mess President Bush left you. Keep up the good work. Thank you for taking the time to read this sir, take care.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1059,"user_ideo":-0.7066,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":701},{"user_id":528466244015474,"comment_id":10153852123094411,"date":"2015-11-14","message":"You can start by taking your fucking country back from the terrorist sympathizing Islamists who would see you dead and your country destroyed.
