Any real investigation on the Clinton emails should be identifying the email recipients and also those who had emails sent to them from any of the Clinton inner circle. It should also include Bill Clinton's emails, and Chelsea Clinton's emails and those of the Clinton Foundation. The emails from the DNC, the Clinton Campaign, and the Clinton foundation will lead to many other discrepancies and if there is a conspiracy going on, these emails (both to and from) would prove it. Second...follow the money. Find out if the State Department gave insider trading information to any of them from government sources which they then manipulated to their donors for both the Clinton campaign and the Clinton Foundation. My best guess is that insider trading has occurred and many of these donors gave huge sums of money so they could profit from them on the stock market. I'm betting the Federal Trade Commission will be the next investigations. Millionaires and billionaires do not give away exorbitant sums of money unless they can profit on it.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7372,"user_ideo":0.3647,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":687},{"user_id":10154463796075530,"comment_id":10153921310161323,"date":"2016-02-06","message":"Good luck with that; they wouldn't even be able to get the USA on board with this.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3196,"user_ideo":-0.6018,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":687},{"user_id":1052104838200354,"comment_id":920354451390943,"date":"2015-08-19","message":"Plus he inherited his daddy's wealth who made millions building public housing for the government","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2246,"user_ideo":-0.7983,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":687},{"user_id":10101323557831317,"comment_id":10151071752044999,"date":"2017-02-03","message":"Yeah but according to the new President, our city is burning and a festering cesspool.
