This article states that she was in an area with easy terrain and heavily marked on maps. To me that indicates that if she were physically able, she would have vacated the area to revisit the trail had something not happened to her unexpectedly. With no injuries or trauma, she must have fallen seriously ill or had a medical emergency that kept her from leaving her campsite. I think that insinuating she died because the area wasn't searched then to go on to say it's because of training is very insulting to searchers. By the time she was reported missing, she was more than likely deceased. Add to that she was traveling alone and nobody had a definite idea of where she was... it's a needle in a haystack to find one woman in the woods. I am always open to new ideas and possibilities but this seems above and beyond the realm of my understanding. To have the energy and ability to set up camp and to pass away inside a sleeping bag within that tent, with a clear and easy path back to fellow hikers, suggests to me that more than likely she went to bed unwell and probably very peacefully passed. Someone found curled up in bedding was not desperately seeking their way back nor would they likely be responsive to search crews. Of which there were plenty.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1439,"user_ideo":-0.6068,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":206,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":222},{"user_id":10207091539623116,"comment_id":10152549833795736,"date":"2015-02-24","message":"Every sporting store i so at does that.
