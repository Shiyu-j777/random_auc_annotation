Only 1 in 5 infected actually show symptoms. Since then it has spread eastward across the Pacific until being diagnosed in central and southern America in 2014. Persons in the Americas and Caribbean have no immune resistance to the virus having never been exposed. It's not 100% proven but is believed to be linked to the rise in infants with microencephaly, which has drastically increased since such as in Brazil where microenchephalic infants increased from ~150/yr to ~3500/yr. This is not a conspiracy against Africa. It didn't come from monkeys. It's not a government conspiracy for lowering the world population, etc., since it was first identified, not invented, in 1947 which is prior to our scientific ability to isolate and study individual genes let alone have the ability to genetically engineer a virus. It's recent rise in the southern and central Americas and the Caribbean are the concern especially with its connection to microencephaly and it's those areas that people are being warned against travelling if you are pregnant or thinking of being pregnant.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1469,"user_ideo":-0.4898,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1123},{"user_id":10153878739523651,"comment_id":10152988421754138,"date":"2015-01-05","message":"Al Gore is enjoying it in hell right now.........Wait he didn't die?
