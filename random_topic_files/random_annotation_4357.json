We have real problems to deal with - like Homeland Security. Look what's happening in the world - ISIS is terrorizing every nation! Their racial issues are on them at this point. They haven't the facts to even back them up. They have blood on their hands! They should be arrested by the hundred at this point, not applauded or appeased. Here are some facts: An African-American Harvard Economist, Roland G. Frye, Jr., just published findings that there is no racial differences between the deadly shootings of whites and blacks by law enforcement in America. He began his study because he was angered by black men being shot by white cops. But his study surprisingly found that police officers use deadly force when they perceive a threat, regardless of skin color. This data undercuts the entire BLM's argument. He summarized by stating \"\"\"\"Yes, there are some instances of criminal acts, but they are far and in between,\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"they are not disproportionate by race.\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9948,"user_ideo":0.7061,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":4},{"user_id":1304844582894499,"comment_id":849609068477508,"date":"2016-04-21","message":"Tom Holmes human gooda","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0994,"user_ideo":-0.4731,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":5},{"user_id":10100142810553594,"comment_id":10154220367041973,"date":"2016-12-06","message":"I'm sorry you had to deal with stupid security officers and store owners... ; however, maybe that Asian salon owner wasn't being racist but rather did not have the education to cut coarser hair and was knowledgeable enough to know where her skills lacked ability. I've had terrible haircuts because the stylist didn't have the knowledge to cut my funky asian hair and didn't inform me of that. Unfortunately not all salon schools or hair stylists learn to cut all types of hair. If she was being racist I'm sorry. Personally i wouldn't want to support her business because either she's racist or needs more training.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0298,"user_ideo":-0.6398,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":6},{"user_id":10154793948278498,"comment_id":10153100893283128,"date":"2015-01-19","message":"Too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3824,"user_ideo":-0.1169,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":7},{"user_id":1767396616891770,"comment_id":10154202704848352,"date":"2016-02-02","message":"So sorry to hear that","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5681,"user_ideo":-0.7582,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":8},{"user_id":550543901802848,"comment_id":10154399775799087,"date":"2016-12-23","message":"Yeah, use your email!
