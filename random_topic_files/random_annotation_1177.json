But yes my default setting for why America is so disliked by so many and why American lives are endangered are the influences of 1 AIPAC and Israel and idiot evangelicals (Cruz&Rubio voters etc),2 Neo Cons as you say and 3 politicians financed by the U.S. arms industry. These three overlap each other greatly to the extent of almost being indistinguishable from each other. And before you sound like the idiots on FOX and crazily equate anti-zionism with anti-semitism, Bernie Sanders is the only candidate that does not fall into 1 or more of these groups and his human decency and intelligence are why almost all non african american muslims in your country support him","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0006,"user_ideo":-0.3881,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":7},{"user_id":1547729568585863,"comment_id":10153914144376162,"date":"2015-12-13","message":"Well there goes the neighborhood","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6988,"user_ideo":-0.1081,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":8},{"user_id":1803674166536833,"comment_id":10152561091646990,"date":"2015-02-10","message":"That is not a catch... everything PG&E decides to do, we have to pay for.. lol please","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1824,"user_ideo":-0.2691,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":9},{"user_id":10205478788403216,"comment_id":10153271830112061,"date":"2015-12-09","message":"Wow thats really nice!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5365,"user_ideo":0.5655,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":10},{"user_id":10153818215695665,"comment_id":1145786698773288,"date":"2016-05-04","message":"Rachel Maddow is an msm hack.
