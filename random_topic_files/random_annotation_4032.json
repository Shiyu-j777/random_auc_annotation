I had an amnio in 1989. If something had been wrong, I would have terminated the pregnancy. I did not want my older 2 kids to have to perhaps eventually have to take care of a child with disabilities because Mom decided to wear a \"\"\"\"badge of honor\"\"\"\". Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so. That decision to have your child is yours, just like it was her decision to terminate. Her decision did not affect you in any way, so why make it personal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0696,"user_ideo":0.6275,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":6},{"user_id":1561569280816592,"comment_id":10155400099831509,"date":"2016-10-04","message":"Great ..

I went years with a sleep disorder and eventually went to a neurologist because I thought was having signs of dementia or something because my memory was horrible. After testing and MRI to rule out other possibilities she suggested I get my stress and sleep problems under control.After trying several things that had bad side effects and left me feeling like a zombie someone suggested essential oils. Bingo! It didn't happen overnight but over the next couple months of trying different combinations my sleep cycle corrected itself. It had made a world of difference in my mind functioning. I don't think people realize how much long term sleep issues can impact your brain. Sorry about the long story but thought it's something really important to think about.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0426,"user_ideo":-0.4018,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":13},{"user_id":1141886422541893,"comment_id":1240008366040019,"date":"2016-04-06","message":"Courage...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3169,"user_ideo":0.4786,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":14},{"user_id":1050947541668269,"comment_id":627384190769404,"date":"2016-10-25","message":"He has a real hard time smiling.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3811,"user_ideo":-0.3376,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":15},{"user_id":282665882103347,"comment_id":10158473557850725,"date":"2017-01-14","message":"I beg to differ with you ,I have family in military, I know personally it has its own pollution!
