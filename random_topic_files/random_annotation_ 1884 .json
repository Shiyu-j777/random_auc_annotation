Your dismissal of Hillary still doesn't address the fact that Trump is continuing to surround himself with the elite and wealthy. The same persons who use loopholes to avoid contributing taxes to our government, who happily send jobs overseas to improve their bottom line but not the life of citizens in the U.S.. How is Trump going to help make our country better when the people he's working with are practiced at only making the lives of their fellow elite members better first? Trickle down economics doesnt work.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0006,"user_ideo":-0.343,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":1},{"user_id":1209633962400466,"comment_id":10153570394643734,"date":"2015-08-16","message":"Daytona","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5528,"user_ideo":-0.7781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":2},{"user_id":1106817792689282,"comment_id":10153679107777061,"date":"2016-06-13","message":"Trump doesn't like to be questioned regarding what he says.
