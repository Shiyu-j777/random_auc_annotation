Are they excluded from this? Or are they to be forced to not only follow the rules that they are told were set up by a mythical creature, but also live out their lives unhappily? Does that also mean that God intends for birth defects to happen? What about people who are born with both male and female parts? Do they have to be forced to live as the gender in which their parents decided at birth, even if they know that it's not right for them? What about free will, the gift that God gave to us mere mortals, does this one defining human trait have absolutely no bearing on this situation? Or are we allowed to have it, so long as it coincides with your beliefs? IF there is a God, and he is omnipotent, then he would not create men and women who feel deeply to their core that they were born in the wrong body. At the very least, if he did happen to make these people, he would give them a way to correct this error for themselves. Oh, wait, he did, he gave them free will, and the technology to assist them in feeling whole.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0102,"user_ideo":-0.58,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":847},{"user_id":10211829345948662,"comment_id":631793790315935,"date":"2016-10-07","message":"I was thinkn \"\"\"\"for the white black and brown people please shave your arm pits before continuing your march\"\"\"\"","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8665,"user_ideo":-0.3212,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":261,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":847},{"user_id":494474564084363,"comment_id":10153971083206336,"date":"2016-01-10","message":"Perhaps, just maybe, he should leave that sort of stuff to Olympic Medalists, just a suggestion.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1671,"user_ideo":0.7993,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":164,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":847},{"user_id":10208668875793560,"comment_id":923604507771386,"date":"2016-10-16","message":"That's because the comment is so stupid, it's not worth refuting.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.143,"user_ideo":-0.7472,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":225,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":847},{"user_id":1237419969601896,"comment_id":10153131730256336,"date":"2015-04-06","message":"Imagine the kids pretending to be Cowboys/Indians, Cops/Robbers, Pirates, Princesses in a castle.
