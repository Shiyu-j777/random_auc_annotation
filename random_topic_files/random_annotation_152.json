While I respect the Native peoples and personally hold the belief that more land should be returned to them, the fact remains that they intentionally chose to challenge the DAPL through lies and manipulation rather then take the opportunity to meet them in court when offered.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7705,"user_ideo":0.451,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":152},{"user_id":1588949291404996,"comment_id":10153101166766336,"date":"2015-03-27","message":"Stop Bullies like this Principle","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.548,"user_ideo":0.8183,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":136,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":152},{"user_id":10209326195364293,"comment_id":10153035518053188,"date":"2015-01-24","message":"Prayers for more answers!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8968,"user_ideo":0.2906,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":102,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":152},{"user_id":1404966509520384,"comment_id":10153726464521833,"date":"2015-08-29","message":"What a smart man, he knows the truth about the real Issues at hand Its not the Gun it's the system that's the Problem, How many warning signs do you need to know that, Crazy is Crazy is the Problem!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9172,"user_ideo":0.8536,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":152},{"user_id":10155228824652627,"comment_id":10153003967846037,"date":"2015-01-09","message":"All this secrecy is alarming with all sides leaking some info about this or that","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.491,"user_ideo":-0.7743,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":140,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":152},{"user_id":10212781044831751,"comment_id":10155818816617316,"date":"2017-01-27","message":"Why wouldn't you base your judgement off of WORK PERFORMANCE???

They supported the boys going on this trip, they supported their licenses and going out on their own. No beacon, no adult on the open water. Would you allow two 14 year old kids to drive from Miami to Tallahassee alone? But that's right, I forgot. If they were to break down driving there would be people nearby. I'm guessing you don't have kids or have never been around 14 year old kids, otherwise you would know how ignorant and blind are your comments. But that's your opinion and this is mine, so I won't shut up.
