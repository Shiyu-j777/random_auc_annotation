To make things clear, I'd like to assure those who innocently believe Fox news's rubbish that no, French are not 16% in favour of Isis. That's completely fake ! It's a lie. And I'll let you check these videos about Paris's \"\"\"\"no-go zones\"\"\"\" : or also (mostly French, for French speakers) , . Thank you Le Petit Journal for having shown the lies. Also, I don't want any misunderstanding. I don't have any grudge against America or against any American person, it's just that this is completely false and I don't want all the people who watched to believe these lies. It's so enormous that it is hard to realize that such a widely spread channel actually said those lies ! Anyway, I hope you had already figured that out. No grudge, as long as people are aware they've been misguided. =)","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":-0.5392,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":853},{"user_id":1026973274066257,"comment_id":10155871333265500,"date":"2015-07-30","message":"I'm certain if the Dentist knew this was a protected Lion he would not have shot.

Not the coal mining country, but Ky has coal mining also. My step-grandmother was from coal mining country, and I have learned a little about how she grew up - abandoned by her father after her mother died and she and her sisters raised by relatives, she married my grandfather after he spent 20 years in prison. Together they made a pretty good life in northern Ky, and I loved her a lot. Everybody has a story. My comments were only to see if people could stop finding blame and find a solution. It looks like everybody sees the problem, coal is dwindling, people haven't made good wages, there is poverty, families have all been coal miners, no money, the companies raped the land and the people, etc, etc. What can be done about the past - NOTHING.
