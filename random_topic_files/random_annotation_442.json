You lost because you stole from America via taxation while telling us that we were the greedy ones. You lost because you dropped more bombs, killed more with drone strikes, and increased tensions with a nuclear superpower all while telling us that we were the war-mongers. You lost because the cities that you controlled spiraled into poverty and crime all while you told us that our policies disenfranchised people. You lost because you told us that gender is simply a social construct all while telling us that Hillary should be president because of her gender. You lost because you support and take money from regimes that imprison or kill gays, subjugate women, and think that rape is a man's right all while telling us that we hate gays, are afraid of women, and promote a culture of rape. You did not lose because we are racist. You did not lose because we are homophobic. You did not lose because we are misogynists or bigots. You lost because you are liars. You lost because you are hypocrites. You lost because you were not witty or clever enough to even hide those facts very well.

As governments saw an ability to harness funds and a third party evil to unite their citizenry around in order to better control that population, governments created positions to further understand how to use such a concept. Think it through. They did not hire individuals who did not agree with the end-goal of human control. They hired individuals who would agree with what their goals. Notice how all the big names left the government side of the industry in the 90's and early 00's? The A crowd. There is a reason. They were replaced with the C & D crowd who will hawk whatever they are told to hawk for a paycheck. That is not science. That is neither good governance nor good long-term policy creation. But it is a great way to usher in control to which most reasonable people would object under any other circumstance.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9854,"user_ideo":0.4647,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":442},{"user_id":1645469692435177,"comment_id":1169415473110087,"date":"2016-06-19","message":"And im not pretending to argue with a Turkish brainwashed backing terrorist bastard","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4581,"user_ideo":0.3342,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":442},{"user_id":10154473928869413,"comment_id":10154832466873812,"date":"2016-09-27","message":"How come i paid taxes and trump did not ....
