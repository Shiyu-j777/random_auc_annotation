Honestly, would you want them as your neighbor? I'm guessing the answer from most people is no. Some of the people were offered other places to go, but didn't want to because it wasn't convenient for them. They expect everything to be handed to them and then they leave behind all of this garbage. Sure they may not have had trucks to move the large stuff in, but needles? Are you kidding me, they could have at least picked up their addiction and taken it with them. If they have money for drugs, they have money to live. The few who work and are struggling get caught in the stream of all of those who don't work and choose to use drugs instead of providing for themselves. I'm sorry, but it's high time that they start contributing to their own care. I can almost guarantee that if you went and told each of those people that you would provide housing for them if they worked on your farm or at your business, they would laugh in your face!
