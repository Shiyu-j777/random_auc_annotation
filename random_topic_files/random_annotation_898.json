How many people of color were ~visible~ in 1969?! If you would watch it, you'd see a young Eleanor Holmes Norton (she's black in case you're to young to know her contributions to women's rights and history) who helps organize a very visible EEOC lawsuit in NYC, one of the first of it's kind, for women working at a newsmagazine who were not allowed to be reporters. There are actually 3 more women of color in the newsroom story, though their lives are not as developed as of yet, in the story line. Yes, it's dramatized; but these kinds of events did take place. Please learn more about history before making uninformed comments.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0009,"user_ideo":-0.7751,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":100,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":898},{"user_id":1047367505311191,"comment_id":10153348329317293,"date":"2015-11-02","message":"Obviously, that way is no longer working specially in US .","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1665,"user_ideo":-0.1227,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":210,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":898},{"user_id":1200332133352038,"comment_id":10153218842742093,"date":"2015-12-19","message":"^^^Boom","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2415,"user_ideo":0.7361,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":898},{"user_id":1398467873503084,"comment_id":10153759886221545,"date":"2016-06-24","message":"Here's free advice.
