The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":10},{"user_id":200208566690736,"comment_id":854538674595187,"date":"2015-07-04","message":"Caption: \"\"\"\"But, gee, you can't be angry just because I watched you take a shower through my own presidential peep hole\"\"\"\".","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2281,"user_ideo":-0.6585,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":11},{"user_id":1134640409949757,"comment_id":10154163158548869,"date":"2016-11-05","message":"I think the dangerous one is Hillary, who destroys evidence of her wrong doing.
