His word is not worth the paper it is written on. Russia had binding agreements with the Ukraine and Georgia and Russia willfully broke all when they invaded and stole away land. The Ukraine trusted the Russians so much that they traded away there nuclear deterrent all for Russia's promise that they would always respect Ukrainian borders and sovereignty. Russia took their nukes and broke their promise. As for Putin being superior to other leaders, how could you possibly know that? Judging by his actions he is a reckless leader who has damaged his nations international reputation and their economy. He is not a superior leader unless you find Machiavellian leaders superior. He has proven himself a dangerous leader. Putin is nothing more than a wealthy oligarch who rules an oligarchy. He has taken his country backwards and not forward. His is a great example of how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. You are a fool to be a follower in his cult of personality.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0549,"user_ideo":-0.275,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":1635080626806485,"comment_id":10153576993393984,"date":"2015-07-15","message":"Awesome!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4299,"user_ideo":0.6278,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":1236439976379629,"comment_id":10154116130334575,"date":"2016-03-24","message":"Happy Birthday Peyton !!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9279,"user_ideo":0.4417,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":10207445220433056,"comment_id":1326692247364524,"date":"2016-11-03","message":"Exactly..I have received many posts on my FL for Amendment 1 to vote \"\"\"\"yes\"\"\"\" yet don't let you comment on it to tell the truth that the wording IS misleading.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3163,"user_ideo":0.5647,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":1532399143444290,"comment_id":10157839985850294,"date":"2016-11-06","message":"Good","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7639,"user_ideo":-0.3835,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":136,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":10209998475469303,"comment_id":10153258560575950,"date":"2015-12-03","message":"thank you , these people need to look back at time , and learn what germans , italians , japanese , went through during world war 2 ,","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8504,"user_ideo":-0.4924,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":1069911189755713,"comment_id":541677766022060,"date":"2016-10-16","message":"Ellie Embry #goals","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0125,"user_ideo":-0.5691,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":95,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":10154937653153442,"comment_id":10153543729666973,"date":"2016-03-20","message":"Trevor Hurley","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1073,"user_ideo":0.3733,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":16,"json_serial_number":1115},{"user_id":10205135986119509,"comment_id":10154636685573797,"date":"2016-05-13","message":"This is not at all about just transgenders and it does not stop at the bathroom stall.
