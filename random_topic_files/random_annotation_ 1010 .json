Are we in high school? Or has this actually become middle school? this is THE WORST bunch of cry babies I've ever seen. First of all- Walmart doesn't close a store because of a rumor (this is not responsible news reporting so lets make this news source know that). Second-- if that store is MAKING MONEY they also won't close a store. How many walmarts across this nation are dry and they still make money. (Let me answer that for you HUNDREDS.) So before you start bashing a retailer that brings more revenue and jobs than most other retailers in that community id say you are a bunch of ungrateful residence. Do your research and stop believing everything you read on the Internet. ðŸ„","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5617,"user_ideo":0.3718,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":1},{"user_id":10210012233005359,"comment_id":1333773983307489,"date":"2016-10-23","message":"The people are the militia... simple stuff.

I think video games are mediums that blend visuals, sounds, etc together in an attempt to tell a story. Imo, that is art: telling a story. Does that mean Call of Duty is art?
