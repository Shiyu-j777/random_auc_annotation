Are you serious right now? Are we in high school? Or has this actually become middle school? this is THE WORST bunch of cry babies I've ever seen. First of all- Walmart doesn't close a store because of a rumor (this is not responsible news reporting so lets make this news source know that). Second-- if that store is MAKING MONEY they also won't close a store. How many walmarts across this nation are dry and they still make money. (Let me answer that for you HUNDREDS.) So before you start bashing a retailer that brings more revenue and jobs than most other retailers in that community id say you are a bunch of ungrateful residence. Do your research and stop believing everything you read on the Internet. ðŸ„","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5617,"user_ideo":0.3718,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":20}]
