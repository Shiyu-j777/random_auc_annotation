Nor I have agreed with their foreign policy. Nor are the States the pillar and only example of democracy. Your argument is that because there is no direct democracy, a totalitarian dictatorship is a better choice? Again why are you here? In these capitalist evil world we are living in. There is a better one, you just need to buy a ticket, the good state of NK will take care of the rest. Just go to the custom office and say you hate America and the western capitalist pigs and you are set.

Your dismissal of Hillary still doesn't address the fact that Trump is continuing to surround himself with the elite and wealthy.

How is Trump going to help make our country better when the people he's working with are practiced at only making the lives of their fellow elite members better first?
