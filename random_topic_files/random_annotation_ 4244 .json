During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said.
