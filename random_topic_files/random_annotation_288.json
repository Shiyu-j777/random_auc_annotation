When my kids come home from their friends house and tell me everything that they got for Christmas! Sorry kid! His family makes more and we have twice as many kids as they do! I get around it by having a rhyme for their gifts : \"\"\"\"something they want, something they need, something to wear, something to read\"\"\"\". My kids always get pj's on Christmas eve. This is the \"\"\"\"Something to wear\"\"\"\". This allows me on Christmas morning to bring it back to Christ. Baby Jesus received three gifts. We only give our children 3 gifts Christmas day. Our kids also choose three toys to donate. This year we have gone through 25 days of Christ. It is found online and you hang an ornament representing something from Christ's life and ministry each night after a short devotional. We follow this with family prayer. This has really brought our focus back to what is most meaningful at Christmas. Christ and family time together.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9499,"user_ideo":0.879,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":288},{"user_id":1207886805930514,"comment_id":10153653720359575,"date":"2015-08-26","message":"Sad, It Wasn't her fault...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5592,"user_ideo":0.3078,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":160,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":288},{"user_id":1155650617814216,"comment_id":1140851485967498,"date":"2016-04-20","message":"Stop crying Bernie!!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3197,"user_ideo":-0.7234,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":288},{"user_id":10208809568989446,"comment_id":10154797413751509,"date":"2016-05-13","message":"I just saved 15% by switching to Geico","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4166,"user_ideo":-0.6129,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":288},{"user_id":10210674281839651,"comment_id":1303391803061418,"date":"2016-12-20","message":"Never give up, Wayne!!
