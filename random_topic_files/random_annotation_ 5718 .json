He only use the Emmanuel 9 as an hateful and evil excuse!!! All he did with that \"\"\"\"suicide note,\"\"\"\" was rely on the very hopes of trying to push this nation's racial divisions further apart!!! It's saddening the state of people's minds, I've read plenty of racial comments (of all races) on a couple of these news threads already....sadly, we have some (of all races) who feel the need to even comment on race instead of using human decency and sending your personal condolences to the families of the victims here....instead you breed hate, all of you are a part of our nation's problems....you're nothing but a race baiters!!!! And I am truly becoming to realize there are many, many among our races....who have absolutely NO DESIRE to bridge the racial gap with unity, love, compassion, acceptance of each other....they rather just continue to fuel the fire with hate and feeling their self-worth is most more important than their neighbors....and we all neighbors white, black, hispanic, asian, or any of nationality!!!! Instead of them showing empathy/love in the news thread....they show hate/evil.....it's maddening!!!! Even last week people spit words of racism back and forth over Jamyla Bolden....,instead of showing compassion....many began to throw racial degoratory remarks back and forth...absolutely left out and forgot about that 9 year olds innocent life!!! Honestly, if we the people don't get a handle in all this deep rooted racism....it's only going to become worse and it will absolutely destroy this nation we love!!!

The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":17},{"user_id":1840083576213842,"comment_id":10153487908371509,"date":"2015-03-21","message":"PDP doctrine on point.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1526,"user_ideo":-0.0846,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":18},{"user_id":10155086202327926,"comment_id":10154635019266037,"date":"2016-09-09","message":"So if Larry king can pull one over on him, how could he run a country?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2427,"user_ideo":-0.7543,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":19},{"user_id":10154393711521624,"comment_id":10153397066320950,"date":"2016-02-17","message":"Here's a little course for you.
