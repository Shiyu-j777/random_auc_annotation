Plenty of people have mental illnesses and are still capable of living normal lives. I believe it's the events that happen in a person's life that pushes them over the edge. It could happen to any person. Lets say someone is going through a child custody crisis and one parent is not letting the other see their child. It could be enough to make the parent being neglected get a gun and kill the other. Or maybe someone is feeling treated unfairly at work. They could snap and kill all the people were they work.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0541,"user_ideo":-0.7762,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":765},{"user_id":10209046630421550,"comment_id":1609612972675920,"date":"2016-11-03","message":"ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5537,"user_ideo":-0.3579,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":765},{"user_id":616483275192293,"comment_id":10150674584709999,"date":"2015-10-03","message":"Joie, if he was really trying to help he would get to the root of the cause and it wasn't a gun it's the rotting of our society","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9784,"user_ideo":0.3863,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":233,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":765},{"user_id":10154362605764787,"comment_id":10153804653011336,"date":"2015-11-02","message":"I prefer a nice relaxing trans-Atlantic cruise.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1431,"user_ideo":0.3212,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":765},{"user_id":1080506888694419,"comment_id":1772378519682295,"date":"2017-01-07","message":"Yes ,laws should be followed.
