If anything the lack of anger (and name) for Meursault's victim said something not only about the 'absurd' of life but about the social values of Algiers at that time. His whole philosophy was seeing the beauty of life and the absurd injustice of it. He was a humanitarian and a fighter for freedom. 'The Plague' being a perfect example. I haven't read this book by Mr. Daoud, so I can't say what his feeling about Mr. Camus is (it seems he enjoys his material given the basis of this novel) but the article sure comes across as pointing the injustice finger at Camus, which is absurd.

Amazing his trump thinks and works. He finds the lowest of the low to be part of his team. It sadness me that mostly white men don't see through him. It's just about winning the game to Him. He is a narcissistic and a lier. He has built his life on lying snd bullying. I heard an article about a group of girls who sang at his convention. They promised a table for them to sell their music since they weren't going to pay them. After they sang the group looked for the table that was promised. They were told oh sorry we forgot.
