If you read my comment carefully, I also actually implied that South Korea is not ready to attract top talents not necessarily because of English issue but also because of its lack of reputation for immigrants (which also include international students as well) implicitly. For a country that could not produce any single Nobel Laureate in any of hard scientific research field, it is laughable if it can pull in top researchers around the world. Even if a country now starts funding a huge chunk of funds into research, I highly doubt it can compete with top-tier American universities or U of T/Mcgill/UBC. Let's look at it this way. If you are Messi/Ronaldo, would you join Chinese legaue or Korean League for the sake of millions of bucks? I don't think so. The funding matters only when your institution already has enough reputation to pull in top talents. You would not go to say, Seoul National University rejecting the offer from U of T just because SNU offers you a full research funding. Europe is definitely on the another league when it comes to research and the degree of academics. In fact, their research is not at all behind top-tier American institutions or U of T. But I am not saying language does not play any role here. If you got into U.S/Canadian university that is as equally great as European one, wouldn't most of people prefer going to English speaking institution honestly? Of course, if you compare Heidelberg with some mid-tier university in Canada, you will definitely choose German one obviously. But, still, speaking in English could become a factor when it comes to studying or immigrating in that sense as well.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.018,"user_ideo":-0.3325,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":9},{"user_id":1046793795447296,"comment_id":10153725026616336,"date":"2015-09-30","message":"Send Geraldo after it!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7301,"user_ideo":0.8614,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":10},{"user_id":10154050400712115,"comment_id":10154445407109411,"date":"2016-06-26","message":"Ridiculous!!! Reality is, the U.S. is aggressively meddling in the affairs of other countries. The U.S. and NATO are instigating and ratcheting tensions against Russia via a very effective BS propaganda campaign via Western mainstream(corporate) media, economic sanctions, military maneuver and military bases along Russia's borders.
