There are Christian Kurdish women who have formed their own militia...and they've been quite effective at fighting ISIS. One of ISIS's biggest fears is being killed by women. They believe it will prevent them from being allowed into their warped version of \"\"\"\"paradise\"\"\"\" with their \"\"\"\"72 virgins\"\"\"\". Might not be a bad strategy to consider with our women who want and are capable of being on the front lines.

Why because it's easy for you to sit at your computer questioning the motives of others but it's much harder to stand up and say what you stand for. So again are you here defending the Dallas shooter, plain and simple straight forward question. Answer it. But I will actually answer your question because I have nothing to hide from you or an internal affairs investigator or anybody else. So no I've never turned in another officer, why? Because I've never witnessed an officer do something that I felt required that. See if another officer did something in front of me that I felt was wrong or was too far, I talked to that officer about it. I was a grown man about mine ( not just talking it of typing it on Facebook) I pulled those 2 officers aside and 1 on 1, man to man I explained to them they were wrong and that it wouldn't happen again in my presence. And so far it has never happened again. And again, yes if an officer did something so outrageous that I felt a internal investigation was warranted then yes I would make the complaint.
