Woke up, as I usually do, at 2am to go to the bathroom and kept hearing a \"\"\"\"thump-thump-thump\"\"\"\", startlling me; turns out it was my left arm clanging on the wall, dead as a doornail. I was in the middle of having another stroke! Linda called my son who met us half way to the hospital and received treatment. However, i learned later to NEVER do that - call 911 instead. As soon as they arrive the EMT's begin treatment, forwarding vitals to the hospital, etc. and saves ER admittance time, also. Took 3 days before they'd let me out of bed to take a shower; they agreed I was ripe, lol~","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2261,"user_ideo":-0.6065,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":4},{"user_id":1749781341956355,"comment_id":10153164314621162,"date":"2015-02-17","message":"True love lives on.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4209,"user_ideo":-0.4059,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":5},{"user_id":10206590497632174,"comment_id":10153814531838984,"date":"2015-10-10","message":"I like this guy!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6392,"user_ideo":0.8687,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":6},{"user_id":1105189476193833,"comment_id":10154228048376509,"date":"2015-11-18","message":"Lol, oooooh the barrio is coming out of him, lol.
