Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":5},{"user_id":1175949132477827,"comment_id":10153087914704060,"date":"2015-02-20","message":"The oil is of Julio Garcia","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2827,"user_ideo":-0.3758,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":137,"index":6},{"user_id":1736737763250828,"comment_id":10153513534986509,"date":"2015-03-30","message":"Oh wow.

I do hope the title is meant to be read as a sign of hope, people pay that money because they probably want to see the game be made. How can you expect a fully functional game of that size before putting in considerable amounts of money? Just think of the latest GTA with a 1/4 of a billion funding.
