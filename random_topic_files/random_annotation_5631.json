Other civilized countries can and do have better laws on gun control. I'm not a paranoid person who sees shadows and someone coming for them at every turn. What I do see are children gunned down, normal every day people at movies gun down, Universities students gun down, Marines gun down, people in a church gun down. This is real life for us now. Not a TV show. We are in a sad state of affairs. It's not the Presidents fault. He has talked and talked upon every slaughter.

Every single opportunity that a preacher gets to make himself rich off of your tythes, he will take it, and there is nothing that the law will do about it. That opportunity to get rich off of an invisible product is one of the main reasons that religion was invented in the first place. And why do you think that you know Christianity better than anyone else? You are going off of the same book that Benny Hinn goes off of, and other millionaire preachers use to justify skimming. Don't be so sure that you have found the right way.
