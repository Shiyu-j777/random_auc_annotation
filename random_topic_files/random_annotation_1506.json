Richard Grossi, of Milford, died at age 55 on October 21, 2009. Joshua Fromer, of Lynn, died at age 19 on August 23, 2005. He was killed in a motorcycle crash with an illegal alien with prior violations. Scott Coxell, of Waltham, died at age 39 on November 23, 2011. He was run over in a crosswalk by a car that police believe was driven by an illegal alien unlicensed driver who fled the scene. She was charged, but later retracted her confession. Her boyfriend claimed responsibility, but escaped prosecution because authorities had no evidence that he was responsible. Sara Escudero, of Stoughton, died at age 64 on June 24, 2013. She was killed while driving to her job as a nurse by an illegal alien visa overstayer who was driving drunk and unlicensed after a night of partying. Ashton Cline-McMurray, of Boston, died at age 16 on October 13, 2000. He was killed by a group of Asian Tiny Rascals gang members, including at least one illegal alien from Cambodia, named Loeun Heng. After Cambodia refused to accept Heng for deportation and ICE had to release him six months later according to the terms of aSupreme Court ruling, the case brought national attention to the problem of court-ordered criminal alien releases, which now number in the thousands, including more than 100 convicted murderers like Heng.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9835,"user_ideo":0.7519,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":8},{"user_id":1726868930863991,"comment_id":10154769058084749,"date":"2016-10-11","message":"Paresh Prasad one of the reason why our wedding clothes is priceless!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0083,"user_ideo":-0.2447,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":9},{"user_id":10210418983138563,"comment_id":10151010831259999,"date":"2016-12-15","message":"Blow me","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7376,"user_ideo":-0.8722,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":10},{"user_id":10207008544837404,"comment_id":10153158195954087,"date":"2015-08-27","message":"My mail delivery is maybe 3days a week in the middle of a city !!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6129,"user_ideo":-0.6619,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":11},{"user_id":1789160044704425,"comment_id":10153848988746051,"date":"2016-06-17","message":"Only straight white people the republicans and right winger....think have all the right in this mercia.....even tho the the born and raise one who's .....parent are immigrant are not welcome.....so you know they're listening.....they dont feel welcome haters.....as illianne Saintfalin, says racism is alive and well!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0027,"user_ideo":-0.698,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":12},{"user_id":10209511045508367,"comment_id":10154349689356336,"date":"2016-06-08","message":"is admitted into physic ward due to metal claims of obscurity","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3273,"user_ideo":-0.5733,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":13},{"user_id":10154571796233891,"comment_id":1102457799770540,"date":"2015-03-18","message":"Creating a bunch if allergy filled wimps","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7737,"user_ideo":-0.1511,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":14},{"user_id":1389329781100024,"comment_id":784934968272671,"date":"2016-07-14","message":"Lost in shipping?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3418,"user_ideo":-0.7299,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":15},{"user_id":10207086444868571,"comment_id":10154436385688279,"date":"2016-09-01","message":"civil war?
