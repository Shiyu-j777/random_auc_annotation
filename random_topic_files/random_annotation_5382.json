Funny. Not only is the choice of venue to capture cowardly, they are taking children into the building so they can hide behind them! Such brave men! But language matters! You need to use the proper term for these people. They are domestic treasonous terrorists. They are not a peaceful assembly of protest- those don't involve carrying weapons- and they are not a militia. A militia is a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. It is not separatists taking up arms against the lawful government. Taking up arms against the government is treason. So these people are not only terrorists, but are committing treason. Every person over the age of 18 who enters that building needs to be held acountable for their treasonous acts. Every adult or adults who take a minor into that building need to be declared unfit parents and lose parental rights for extreme child endangerment.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0045,"user_ideo":-0.4819,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":9},{"user_id":10210422658620439,"comment_id":952405744806053,"date":"2015-08-27","message":"May God help this man and know the Truth of Jesus.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9837,"user_ideo":0.8257,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":10},{"user_id":10207506253514766,"comment_id":1303260856436830,"date":"2016-09-28","message":"post ACTUAL facts that back ANY of that up?

Not every black person is a criminal, in fact I have several friends who are Doctors and professionals. Not all white people are racist. Not all of us think people who aren't white are inferior. However, unfortunately in this country negativity gets the press. The ones of us who exist side by side and work hard, live within the law, and behave accordingly never make the news.

Do you what it's like to be a public servant?! To go to work everyday hoping to God when they call 911 they actually need help and aren't setting you up. To work on an ambulance, completely unarmed I add, and knock on a door to help a total stranger. Or to be a police officer and answer a calm to defend or protect people you've never met? If you don't know what it's like to be a public servant, furthermore a police officer, shut up and stop telling them how to do there jobs. I am not saying their all perfect but then again no one is. So I'll reiterate my previous statement. If you have nothing more intelligent to say than \"\"\"\"that's what you get\"\"\"\" in support of a man who killed 5 cops who had NOTHING to do with previous cop vs civilian situations than shut your ignorant mouth and stop spewing senseless hatred. You talk about uniting, but then you spew moronic, counterproductive, and misplaced anger and hatred. Before you can help unite anyone you first need to step back and think before you type next time","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7163,"user_ideo":0.5006,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":16},{"user_id":10208748799851261,"comment_id":1613979418620063,"date":"2017-02-25","message":"Drain the swamp","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9878,"user_ideo":-0.5308,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":17},{"user_id":10207412272565519,"comment_id":1582178521841890,"date":"2016-10-28","message":"I can smell you from here.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2607,"user_ideo":0.2604,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":79,"index":18},{"user_id":10100944252896813,"comment_id":942076939145393,"date":"2015-02-12","message":"Prices too high and customer service sucks","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.381,"user_ideo":-0.1193,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":75,"index":19},{"user_id":10153690019966674,"comment_id":10153953243011323,"date":"2016-02-20","message":"I wondered where Grandpa left it.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.26,"user_ideo":0.062,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":32,"index":20}]
