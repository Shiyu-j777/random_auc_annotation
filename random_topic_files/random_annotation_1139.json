Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":2},{"user_id":1195287833856683,"comment_id":483712141819366,"date":"2015-02-10","message":"Get him.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4247,"user_ideo":0.7532,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":252,"index":3},{"user_id":10209106429195309,"comment_id":10152930789946336,"date":"2015-01-29","message":"I may have don it I can't remember....","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5713,"user_ideo":0.8657,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":4},{"user_id":1173062902715290,"comment_id":10153694348980530,"date":"2015-09-01","message":"- See Look who's Sales are UP and look whose Sales are DOWN - FCA sales up 1.7%; Ford up 5.4%; GM down 0.7%.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4563,"user_ideo":-0.1682,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":5},{"user_id":1063488683720551,"comment_id":10153110444482623,"date":"2015-11-06","message":"Thank you , however I would like to say that I have many atheists friends who are offended by it and I am entitled to my opinion.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6837,"user_ideo":-0.0481,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":6},{"user_id":1389329781100024,"comment_id":784934968272671,"date":"2016-07-14","message":"Lost in shipping?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3418,"user_ideo":-0.7299,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":7},{"user_id":1098144986942925,"comment_id":10154678748633279,"date":"2016-11-16","message":"Brave of them.
