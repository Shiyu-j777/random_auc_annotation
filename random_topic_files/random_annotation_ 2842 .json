Thus it is easier for those at the top to have greater control over all of us . Someday soon I believe we will come see the reality of this. United we stand divided we fall. This way how can the masses work together when Uncle Sam becomes totalitarian : a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state.

They also save money by refusing to have a large enough staff on duty to watch the floor and deter shoplifting... Meaning that in some cities as many as two officers pretty much spend their days dealing with crimes at Walmart... and the taxpayers pay for those police officers... Meaning that once again we are subsidizing Walmart's cost of doing business. Also...

I do not know, but I trust my God with my whole heart! I, Maxine, can say this with certainty. MY SON died suddenly in Dec. and I know there was a reason he was allowed to go. You see, I believe in the Bible. I believe God when he said our days were numbered before we were formed in our mothers' womb. You see God is omnipotent, omniscient and always has been. In His kind and generous love he gave us our last nine months with our grown son (even moving us from another state, finding a buyer for our farm and letting us live WITH him for 3 months while we found the right house). We were so Blessed to have this wonderful person in our life and now I know he is not suffering any of life's burdens. I do not know about this 14 year old girl. I do not know if her decision is the right one. That is between her and God. BUT I do know that God could save her! I know that if it is in HIS plan He will. But I also know He will not leave her. He has not abandoned her. He never has and never will.
