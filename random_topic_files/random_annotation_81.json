I think most of the science is sound and we have pushed ourselves off the natural trajectory. I have enough of a science background to understand much of the raw data, how it fits together, and how contrarian views are encouraged. To me the reason why the \"\"\"\"man-made\"\"\"\" part of climate change is important is not to blame people: I and my family would also be complicit. Instead it's because it gives us hope that we can change it. For the last 150 years we have been putting tremendous amounts of pollutants into our air without realizing what it had been doing to our environment and health. Right now, dirty power plants have the advantage because they don't pay a price for all that pollution coming out of their smokestacks. A carbon tax IS the way to use the free market because it makes the playing field level for everyone.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0009,"user_ideo":-0.5796,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":81},{"user_id":1267088970003096,"comment_id":10153006095407217,"date":"2015-08-08","message":"Her you go, !
