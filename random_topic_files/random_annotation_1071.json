As governments saw an ability to harness funds and a third party evil to unite their citizenry around in order to better control that population, governments created positions to further understand how to use such a concept. Think it through. They did not hire individuals who did not agree with the end-goal of human control. They hired individuals who would agree with what their goals. Notice how all the big names left the government side of the industry in the 90's and early 00's? The A crowd. There is a reason. They were replaced with the C & D crowd who will hawk whatever they are told to hawk for a paycheck. That is not science. That is neither good governance nor good long-term policy creation. But it is a great way to usher in control to which most reasonable people would object under any other circumstance.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9854,"user_ideo":0.4647,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":1071},{"user_id":10153827440458951,"comment_id":10153326281633717,"date":"2015-10-22","message":"...Said the guy who wants to be a pumpkin.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1658,"user_ideo":-0.4785,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":3,"json_serial_number":1071},{"user_id":1857574524474440,"comment_id":804901773033733,"date":"2016-06-13","message":"More fiction from .","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.405,"user_ideo":0.4157,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":163,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":1071},{"user_id":10210434508678769,"comment_id":10153007028381336,"date":"2015-02-23","message":"I'm going to kill these kids someday","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4823,"user_ideo":0.4211,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":121,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1071},{"user_id":10154742389933449,"comment_id":10153378905934607,"date":"2016-01-27","message":"I will so happy going back to work!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6002,"user_ideo":-0.4002,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":92,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1071},{"user_id":1076880012400445,"comment_id":701682786673802,"date":"2016-11-11","message":"whewwwww I can smell the racist YOU a mile a way.
