Also, why is anyone even giving credencce to anything Trump is saying regarding this? He separated himself from the pageant or they separated from him. He, supposedly, has nothing to do with it anymore. So, why doesn't he just shut up. Miss Colombia seems to think she actually won it and it was taken from her, officially. Someone needs to emphasize to her that she did not, in fact, win anything. It was an unfortunate mistake so why should there be any sharing. I guess some folks believe that a person who is mistakenly given a crown should be rewarded for it...why???
