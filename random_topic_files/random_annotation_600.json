Exactly as the RNC wanted once Jeb and Rubio were gone. I predicted on Facebook before the GOP convention that Trump would stay in until after the convention and then drop out and the RNC would pick the candidate they want. The RNC is behind this. They needed Trump to keep out CRUZ and now with the help of the media they are driving out Trump so they can put in their guy. If he dropped out before the convention, the delegates might have chosen Cruz and they couldn't let that happen. So now the RNC will choose who they want. And everyone will be so relieved it's not Trump, we will all jump on board. When I first said this. I was only about 50% sure it would happen. I was pretty shocked to hear today that there is talk of Trump dropping out and how he might be replaced. But make no mistake, this has been the plan for quite a while.
