Russia had just as many issues in Afghanistan as we did. guerilla warfare is always a threat to a large bulky military, that's how the Americans won the Revolutionary War for the most part. we had the same problems in Vietnam and in Iraq and Afghanistan. but wars between two \"\"\"\"equally\"\"\"\" matched large nations are not even comparable. you're oversimplifying far too much. to win, they would have to invade us, not just repel an invasion. we DO have functional stealth, I'm surprised you dont realize that. we invented stealth almost forty years ago. China hasnt come close to matching our technology from 20 years ago. same with Russia. China has one advantage, a large army. Russia has one advantage, a more robust cyberwarfare department. in every other category, we are superior.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1925,"user_ideo":-0.6485,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":7},{"user_id":1326969027366348,"comment_id":1129363933781908,"date":"2016-04-16","message":"How about we start using more surface recognition.

I do tend to look at people oddly when they drink cow's milk because I think it's disgusting. For those who don't look at others oddly when they drink cow's milk, their reasonings are likely because when we drink cow's milk, it's usually out of a cup, which comes from a carton/jug/bag. We don't generally see grown humans hanging off of a cow's udder when they want a drink. That would be weird.. and we would look at them oddly.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0205,"user_ideo":-0.5775,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":13},{"user_id":992727680845130,"comment_id":385726698275878,"date":"2015-01-30","message":"Yeah that's one dollar...","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.274,"user_ideo":-0.5664,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":14},{"user_id":10209063316773090,"comment_id":10153047684752452,"date":"2015-08-27","message":"Omg really come one who cares how she feels..
