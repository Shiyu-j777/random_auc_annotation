However, not all apples are equal. Sure would be nice to know the carrots came from land that wasn't full of residual pesticides. That the burgers weren't pink slime, that the lettuce hadn't been sprayed with poison and the milk was actually healthy. I don't think vending machines belong in public schools, but if they are water and both chewy and crunchy nutrition bars should be the only options. That should be a district choice though.

He only use the Emmanuel 9 as an hateful and evil excuse!!! All he did with that \"\"\"\"suicide note,\"\"\"\" was rely on the very hopes of trying to push this nation's racial divisions further apart!!! It's saddening the state of people's minds, I've read plenty of racial comments (of all races) on a couple of these news threads already....sadly, we have some (of all races) who feel the need to even comment on race instead of using human decency and sending your personal condolences to the families of the victims here....instead you breed hate, all of you are a part of our nation's problems....you're nothing but a race baiters!!!! And I am truly becoming to realize there are many, many among our races....who have absolutely NO DESIRE to bridge the racial gap with unity, love, compassion, acceptance of each other....they rather just continue to fuel the fire with hate and feeling their self-worth is most more important than their neighbors....and we all neighbors white, black, hispanic, asian, or any of nationality!!!! Instead of them showing empathy/love in the news thread....they show hate/evil.....it's maddening!!!! Even last week people spit words of racism back and forth over Jamyla Bolden....,instead of showing compassion....many began to throw racial degoratory remarks back and forth...absolutely left out and forgot about that 9 year olds innocent life!!! Honestly, if we the people don't get a handle in all this deep rooted racism....it's only going to become worse and it will absolutely destroy this nation we love!!!
