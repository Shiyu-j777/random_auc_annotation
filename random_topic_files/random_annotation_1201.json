That can/could be crucial to both sides. The lack of testing can help the officer's defense, as they can argue that it provides reasonable doubt of who's at fault, especially if the teen was making a turn from an undesignated area. On the other hand, it could've helped the teen prove his innocence(?), providing the test was negative(?). Either way, it is very tragic that two very young and beautiful teen girls lost their lives.
