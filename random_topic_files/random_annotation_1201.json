If anything the lack of anger (and name) for Meursault's victim said something not only about the 'absurd' of life but about the social values of Algiers at that time. His whole philosophy was seeing the beauty of life and the absurd injustice of it. He was a humanitarian and a fighter for freedom. 'The Plague' being a perfect example. I haven't read this book by Mr. Daoud, so I can't say what his feeling about Mr. Camus is (it seems he enjoys his material given the basis of this novel) but the article sure comes across as pointing the injustice finger at Camus, which is absurd. Ha! Couldn't resist the pun. I slay myself.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0024,"user_ideo":-0.5869,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":1201},{"user_id":10158879274370034,"comment_id":1121837374569297,"date":"2016-09-16","message":"I used to do this!
