They have an extraordinary record of wasting billions on a project that won't get used. I am disgusted with the whole bunch of them. They are being paid to enable projects like these. While it may be faster and unmanned, I seriously doubt if it's cheaper than anything else we're making. Bottom line is that we should NOT be making more war machines; we need to turn our attention toward the making of peaceful countries. War is not anachronous and threatens all of humanity and the future of the world. Having peace would save ALL countries a bundle. We need a Department of Peace that will put clamps on these criminal runaway budgets for more war toys. Someone needs to step and be an adult and tell the children to quit fighting.
