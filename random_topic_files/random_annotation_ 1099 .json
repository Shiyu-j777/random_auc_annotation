And that's all I was really trying to ask. You and I both watched Clinton and Trump speeches without media bias and simply came to different conclusions. You and I both, as well as plenty of other Americans, put in the research to lead us to choose who we voted for as president. I was hoping for more actually related to his business and Trump News than Clinton coming up again. Trump is the president elect so I was wondering about him. Maybe you assume I'm tugging at some strings or something, but I was just looking for more on the business aspect.
