The Democratic National Convention leaders committed fraud and rigged the primary process in favor of Mrs. Bill Clinton. Basically, her candidacy is illegal as she did not win it fairly. So somebody had the audacity to defend himself when another says he never read the Constitution or never made a sacrifice for anybody. Clearly this dear couple was scripted by the Democrats and exploited them to be a taunt to Donald Trump as a political ploy. IS THERE NO SENSE OF DECENCY OR FAIRNESS ANY MORE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? As a lifelong Democrat of the fabric of JFK/LBJ/JC -- (the last real democrats in office) -- I am totally against the party as it stands today--paid off elected officials , representing only the 1% elite wealthy--controlling both the government and the national media is like a horrific sci-fi movie and worse than 1984. Whatever it takes to be sure that the CLINTONCRATIC usurpers don't get into office is our only hope. They are worse than any terrorists on earth, because they have already take over our USA Government with another political system.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0634,"user_ideo":-0.3338,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":140,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":529},{"user_id":626714887495750,"comment_id":10153239156559586,"date":"2015-04-13","message":"Please stop","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3381,"user_ideo":0.4896,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":529},{"user_id":10209970956532119,"comment_id":10153362288763984,"date":"2015-05-06","message":"Wow, he's really looking old!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.418,"user_ideo":0.3647,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":529},{"user_id":10208801373464211,"comment_id":978414252204642,"date":"2015-08-21","message":"Congrats Ladies u are awesome!!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5801,"user_ideo":-0.5933,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":156,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":529},{"user_id":10201999547306399,"comment_id":1058912160903660,"date":"2017-01-19","message":"What a disgrace","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8105,"user_ideo":-0.4124,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":88,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":529},{"user_id":10210382148179080,"comment_id":10152927639252377,"date":"2015-07-27","message":"I have read what I typed, and I don't see that.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3374,"user_ideo":0.5838,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":529},{"user_id":10208135580679792,"comment_id":10153408501959087,"date":"2015-12-23","message":"Trump and Clinton â€“ Today, in the WSJ, Juan Williams (FOX News) did an op-ed piece suggesting that Obama will be fully involved in the Clinton campaign for the presidency. This is very good news for Trump supporters as I view Obama as the Republicans secret weapon. I have no doubt that Obama will not leave office without kicking and screaming. I see him doing everything he possibly can to inflict is radical ultra-liberal anti-American agenda on the American public whether we like it or not. Unfortunately he may succeed on many fronts as the spineless Republican Party will be nowhere to be found. Obama actions will push lots of independents and Democrats into Trumps camp. In fact I think Trumps support in these two groups is much higher than is generally reported.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9987,"user_ideo":0.76,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":529},{"user_id":964779663650815,"comment_id":10152893574011051,"date":"2015-03-28","message":"How about the schools worry about WHAT our kids are learning instead of what kind of haircut they have?
