Um...I believe those time schedules can be adjusted and make allowance for ships to not hit and kill a whale or two or a hundred. Maybe hire whale spotters during the migration months, or all year round, to spot and track whales and communicate with the incoming and outgoing ships the long and lat coordinates of the whales. Just an out there what if thought. The lack of decency and common sense of some individuals is appalling. Adjusting time schedules...Not rocket science.

I do tend to look at people oddly when they drink cow's milk because I think it's disgusting. For those who don't look at others oddly when they drink cow's milk, their reasonings are likely because when we drink cow's milk, it's usually out of a cup, which comes from a carton/jug/bag. We don't generally see grown humans hanging off of a cow's udder when they want a drink.
