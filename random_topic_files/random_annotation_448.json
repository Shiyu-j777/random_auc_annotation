It has a deliberative function made obvious by how carefully the US Constitution defined the criteria for its selection and how carefully relevant law discussed its meetings, its vote and challenges to its vote (see link). The Electoral College can, based on grounds that can be carefully circumscribed, do the following: -- It can protect our election against well-established foreign influence. -- It can avoid a clear and unanswered constitutional violation that will result from the election of one candidate. (See, e.g. foreign diplomats booking the Trump DC hotel, one obvious violation of the Emoluments Clause, just one example we can currently see given Turmp's paltry financial disclosure.) -- It can protect the clear will of the overwhelming majority, especially when faced with one-sided, last minute intelligence agency disclosures that measurably tilted the election. -- And it can, based on these narrow grounds (which pose little threat in the future and which are, in any event, part of the deal we made centuries ago), protect us against an undisciplined, unprincipled president-elect who has -- on many occasions since the election -- demonstrated his unfitness for the executive office.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":-0.5685,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":1,"json_serial_number":448},{"user_id":10207154827656655,"comment_id":10152913972556051,"date":"2015-04-06","message":"if its in your yard shouldnt make any difference what u have if its something good for the kids toplay in get real people do have kids ???? if not maybe u need to have a few and then see what u would do","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9606,"user_ideo":0.7586,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":210,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":2,"json_serial_number":448},{"user_id":1389714757710523,"comment_id":10153059359036316,"date":"2015-09-18","message":"So what's the problem with this? If there are problems arising that PETA (whom I have little use for btw) takes offense to can they stop the problems sooner? Can they save their own asses without it being criminalized?
