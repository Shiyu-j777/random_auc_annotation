By your comment you brought race in which is race baiting!!!! The only way \"\"\"\"WE\"\"\"\" (ALL RACES INCLUDED) can change is when crimes are committed...treat the people for the crime not calling it out because the pigment of their skin! All I was trying to encourage is, we as a whole nation because to treat everyone according to being fellow man not treat them because they are of a different skin tone!!
