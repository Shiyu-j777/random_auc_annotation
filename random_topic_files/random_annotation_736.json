Despite college eduations 50 million people work in low paid jobs while companies show record profits. Increasing wages would solve many social problems that otherwise involve food stamps welfare foster care juvenile crime.

Her warnings were dismissed as nonfactual & ignored by the governor snyder & his emergency financial manager that he appointed. This was done with no scientific investigation by the gov. only by the fact that since the (one tough nerd as he calls himself) has owned the entire state up to & including the state supreme court under rightwing rule. This governor & his pack of rightwing nazis that have ruled this state for the last 6+ years has done anything they want & almost dared anyone to challenge their rule only to win it in it's crooked court system. Michigan has been ranked dead last in political & court procedure in the entire United States recently & has even gone as far as passing a law to exempt them from the Freedom of Information Act. I'm almost 100% sure that the nerd & his turds just figured this could be handled by the state investigators & handled by the court judges that they own & like all of the other bullshit acts they have pulled will just go away. IMO this young lady is a hero for calling out this corrupt governor & his farout teapublican turds that have ruled this state like it's personal kingdon for as I said the last 6+ years. I hope they all burn in hell for their greedy & unethicle ways.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0008,"user_ideo":-0.8641,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":736},{"user_id":10207228357047363,"comment_id":862111567228476,"date":"2016-07-24","message":"Hillary for prison","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9773,"user_ideo":0.7811,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":736},{"user_id":10209858969251620,"comment_id":1081322088574929,"date":"2015-07-18","message":"You know that these are all victims of earlier Jade Helm exercises and that the Muslim dictator in the White House has actually been traveling back in time to perfect his takeover of Texass....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0006,"user_ideo":-0.8502,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":121,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":736},{"user_id":1321522581205431,"comment_id":1789185718029078,"date":"2016-10-05","message":"Kaine comes off as a rude jerk very un vice presidential why would anyone vote for Hilary/ pence.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5425,"user_ideo":0.7426,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":736},{"user_id":10205098826989027,"comment_id":10153821175933812,"date":"2015-10-07","message":"Give a specific example or you flunk the test.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1947,"user_ideo":-0.5709,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":736},{"user_id":1334859996542755,"comment_id":10153307658440329,"date":"2015-03-30","message":"Powerful, yet sad photo.
