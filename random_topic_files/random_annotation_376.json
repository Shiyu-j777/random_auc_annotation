That's not much snow, especially not over the course of about 20 hrs. Why is it that we have to wait for the very last flake of snow to fall to finally send plows out? I'm from Buffalo NY, this little amount of snow that we just got in Colorado wouldn't have been news-worthy back in Buffalo. Plus, in Buffalo, we can get 2-3 ft of snow in a 24 hr time period and the roads are fine because the plows are actually out throughout the entire \"\"\"\"storm\"\"\"\" actually plowing.
