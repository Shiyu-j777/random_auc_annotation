There's no proof that a jet nor a plane would land with 60MPH on a slight steep slope aiming at the pentagon where the economics building side is, that was bombed by the government under president's orders. As for the planes, the phone calls were voice recorded before the stewardesses had to change their schedules and let the others who aren't them be in it. As for the terrorists in the plane they stayed put on sitting while two government officials steered both planes aiming at the twin towers, and want to know why? GWBJr was scared and skeptic of where the economy, education and health care was taken place and it wasn't from outside of this country. It was inside this country, it was his fault for using too much power in putting most of our funds on more guns and army equipment that we didn't really needed we had enough weapons as it was back then but he took it further for his fears which is why you can never trust a fake Christian to do a good job at being a well balanced president.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0046,"user_ideo":-0.7645,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":215},{"user_id":1083526595016683,"comment_id":1148600005159751,"date":"2016-02-03","message":"I told you that mosquitos are big in Texas.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2415,"user_ideo":0.7752,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":215},{"user_id":10154335250010340,"comment_id":10152988929906336,"date":"2015-02-18","message":"I'm super conservative but there's no story here...","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9886,"user_ideo":0.5449,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":215},{"user_id":10208806545472641,"comment_id":10153178027134087,"date":"2015-09-04","message":"All that pain and suffering for 3% Joe?
