They also save money by refusing to have a large enough staff on duty to watch the floor and deter shoplifting... Meaning that in some cities as many as two officers pretty much spend their days dealing with crimes at Walmart... and the taxpayers pay for those police officers... Meaning that once again we are subsidizing Walmart's cost of doing business. Also...

Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so. That decision to have your child is yours, just like it was her decision to terminate. Her decision did not affect you in any way, so why make it personal.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0696,"user_ideo":0.6275,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":189,"index":20}]
