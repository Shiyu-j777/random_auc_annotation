During the raid, the soldiers briefly detained two of the station¡¯s journalists, Muhammad Amro and Shbeib Shbeib. The International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) sharply condemned the closures. ¡°We cannot tolerate these continuous attacks from Israeli authorities to muzzle Palestinian press,¡± the group¡¯s president Jim Boumelha said. He added that accusations of incitement and the closure of media offices must not occur without due process. Haim Shibi, a member of the foreign relations committee of the National Federation of Israeli Journalists, accused Boumelha of ¡°turning the IFJ into a clear anti-Israel propaganda tool, continually portraying the IDF [Israeli army] as an army that hunts journalists, targets them and kills them.¡±","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0372,"user_ideo":-0.5781,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":9},{"user_id":10208063704243766,"comment_id":10154416380351051,"date":"2017-01-10","message":"If a drunk driver hits you or your vehicle, isn't that assault with a deadly weapon and can you return fire in fear for your life?","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4948,"user_ideo":-0.5468,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":10},{"user_id":1418788728137781,"comment_id":10153376455191545,"date":"2016-01-01","message":"You guys comments are making me LOL!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2217,"user_ideo":0.0051,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":11},{"user_id":299786550404102,"comment_id":10154123504701973,"date":"2016-11-01","message":"Hope they hang in Nevada.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7664,"user_ideo":-0.3859,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":12},{"user_id":10206999458166874,"comment_id":1027456543978157,"date":"2015-09-15","message":"Sounds great until my x gets one....she's a fucking syco","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4909,"user_ideo":0.3112,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":13},{"user_id":1049694961773687,"comment_id":10153513443300575,"date":"2015-08-31","message":"all real human lives matter. these thugs are useless to this country!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9134,"user_ideo":0.9055,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":14},{"user_id":10157429908180393,"comment_id":10152666132711316,"date":"2015-03-27","message":"Or product of California.
