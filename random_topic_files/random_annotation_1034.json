Nor I have agreed with their foreign policy. Nor are the States the pillar and only example of democracy. Your argument is that because there is no direct democracy, a totalitarian dictatorship is a better choice? Again why are you here? In these capitalist evil world we are living in. There is a better one, you just need to buy a ticket, the good state of NK will take care of the rest. Just go to the custom office and say you hate America and the western capitalist pigs and you are set.

Sorry, folks, but that's what a lot of you ladies sound like when putting down someone that made a personal decision to terminate a pregnancy. Like somehow, you are special and deserve some medal because you made YOUR personal decision to continue with your pregnancy and anything otherwise is wrong because you have determined it to be so. That decision to have your child is yours, just like it was her decision to terminate.
