Some states you can get your drivers license at 15. All kids are not raise on electronics and locked up in a house. My kids could drive better than most adults. Truck, go-carts, lawn mowers, four wheelers, boats. Depends on where you live and how you were raised. In Florida water is a part of every day life for most kids. My kids were sailing sunfish at 6-7 years old. Have taken many cost guard classes. Are safer than most adults. By the way they can probably out shoot you too. I have a 19 year old going special forces after graduation. He can lay it down with an AK47. Hell yeh I encourage them to live life and enjoy themselves. Don't just be desk jockeys. My 17 year old boy was traveling the country with a band. Never had any drug problems or cop problems from any of the 6 of them. We are church going Christians. Corp owners.
