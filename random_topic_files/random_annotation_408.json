Not the coal mining country, but Ky has coal mining also. My step-grandmother was from coal mining country, and I have learned a little about how she grew up - abandoned by her father after her mother died and she and her sisters raised by relatives, she married my grandfather after he spent 20 years in prison. Together they made a pretty good life in northern Ky, and I loved her a lot. Everybody has a story. My comments were only to see if people could stop finding blame and find a solution. It looks like everybody sees the problem, coal is dwindling, people haven't made good wages, there is poverty, families have all been coal miners, no money, the companies raped the land and the people, etc, etc. What can be done about the past - NOTHING.
