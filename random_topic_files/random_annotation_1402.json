God created all sorts of people, including hermaphrodites and people who are born with a condition known as intersex, where it is impossible without extensive testing to say if the person is male or female and even then the person might not fit into either category once their bodies start to mature. People used to choose the sex of a hermaphrodite child, and probably many still do, often going for female since it was easier to cut off the male parts than deal with the female parts. Funny thing is a lot of other cultures and religions have no issue dealing with these people, some of these religions even consider them holy or otherwise blessed. But your backwards, bigoted beliefs wants to condemn them simply because they are different. It is you who has the problem, not these people, who fall anywhere on the LGBTTI spectrum who are simply acting in the way your god made them.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0052,"user_ideo":-0.7118,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":55,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1402},{"user_id":10154503505789031,"comment_id":10152869618751545,"date":"2015-04-24","message":"Yes we hate people who abuse women.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4834,"user_ideo":-0.4669,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":165,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":1402},{"user_id":10205545563877963,"comment_id":10154437223712042,"date":"2016-07-27","message":"People have become so detached from their emotions....the less people pray and the more mental illness we see, don't know if there is a correlation but the world we live in now is scary. you can't trust having a simple exchange of words with a stranger let alone a conversation.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9247,"user_ideo":-0.5929,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":164,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1402},{"user_id":1732511686995639,"comment_id":10153833883981336,"date":"2015-11-13","message":"Bobble head babble.
