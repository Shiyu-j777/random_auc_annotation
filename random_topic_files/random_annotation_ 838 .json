Russia had just as many issues in Afghanistan as we did. guerilla warfare is always a threat to a large bulky military, that's how the Americans won the Revolutionary War for the most part. we had the same problems in Vietnam and in Iraq and Afghanistan. but wars between two \"\"\"\"equally\"\"\"\" matched large nations are not even comparable. you're oversimplifying far too much. to win, they would have to invade us, not just repel an invasion. we DO have functional stealth, I'm surprised you dont realize that. we invented stealth almost forty years ago. China hasnt come close to matching our technology from 20 years ago. same with Russia. China has one advantage, a large army.
