A leak or spill could send oil directly into the tribeâ€s main source of drinking water. The tribe points out that Dakota Access originally considered a route farther north, upstream of Bismarck, but the company rejected that route, in part, because of the close proximity to the state capitalâ€s drinking-water wells. Second, the tribe argues that the pipeline would run through a stretch of land north of the reservation that contains recently discovered sacred sites and burial places. True, this land isnâ€t part of the current reservation. But the Standing Rock Sioux argue that the land had been taken away from them unjustly over the past 150 years. And any bulldozing and construction work could damage these sites.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0893,"user_ideo":-0.3698,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":62,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":6,"json_serial_number":36},{"user_id":212833052464067,"comment_id":10158464181990001,"date":"2017-02-01","message":"Oh my god people are so rude","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1765,"user_ideo":-0.0711,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":160,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":36},{"user_id":624816824362414,"comment_id":10154367292034369,"date":"2016-06-01","message":"yes he got away from his mom who was not watching him so this poor animal had to die wth just admit the mom was very wrong","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.7806,"user_ideo":0.5061,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":36},{"user_id":10210106247077914,"comment_id":10153716844954749,"date":"2015-10-15","message":"when that kitten got out of the establishment and run over, they signed to KOko what happened and she cried like a baby, so yes, very bright.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2561,"user_ideo":0.0159,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":51,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":36},{"user_id":10208768810550011,"comment_id":10153498853566336,"date":"2015-07-23","message":"Thanks I did study the Islam, Judaism, Christianity during my undergraduate years so thanks I can deceiver between what the religions practices and beliefs are and those who are religious extremists bc oh I'm educated...

We see their smiles when they can move. I believe the enjoyment children derive from movement and challenging their physical abilities comes from their being wired up to develop. They work constantly to learn and develop! :-) This is more than physical development, although that is important, it also develops important neural pathways. The current fad of pushing \"\"\"\"academic\"\"\"\" learning on younger and younger children is badly misguided. Finland doesn't do what the US does but then we wouldn't want to be recognized as the best education system on the planet. Our children might be smarter if we copied Finland.
