On Sunday, 3.7 million people gathered all over France to mourn the lives of those killed in last week's Charlie Hebdo attack. It was almost a moving collective stand for freedom of expression in the face of terror and fear except that its most prominent supporters are much greater threats to a free press than terrorism. As the non-profit Reporters Without Borders noted on Sunday, and as London School of Economics Middle East Society co-president Daniel Wickham elaborated in a widely disseminated series of tweets, the world leaders given prominent photo-op placement at the Paris rally are not only free-press hypocrites they're by any measure worse threats to the world-changing possibilities of a free press than a couple terrorists with guns. Your murderer's row: U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron In 2013, the British prime minister publicly threatened to use court injunctions against newspapers that published information from the Edward Snowden leaks. When the Guardian published anyway, technicians from the GCHQ arrived at the newspaper's office and forced editors to destroy their hard-drives with angle grinders. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu In July, Reporters Without Borders detailed what it called the \"\"\"\"deliberate targeting\"\"\"\" of news professionals with arrests and intimidation by Netanyahu's Israeli Defense Forces in the 2014 Gaza conflict. The next month, Palestinian photojournalist Rami Rayan was found among the dead after an IDF rocket attack on a Gaza marketplace. He was wearing a vest marked \"\"\"\"PRESS.\"\"\"\" Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar In 2013, Slovenian blogger Mitja Kunstelj was sentenced to six months in prison for \"\"\"\"defaming\"\"\"\" and \"\"\"\"insulting\"\"\"\" two fellow journalists on his blog. Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny In Ireland, blasphemy is a criminal offense. Polish Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz Polish law enforcement officials raided the office of the magazine Wprost after it published a secretly recorded conversation between two government officials last year. Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras Photojournalist Tatiana Bolari was beaten by riot police at a demonstration in Athens last year, even though her gear \"\"\"\"clearly identified her as a journalist,\"\"\"\" according to Reporters Without Borders. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov Russia famously banned LGBT \"\"\"\"propaganda\"\"\"\" in 2013. Last year, officials arrested a journalist for interviewing an advocate of Siberian independence. Algerian Foreign Minister Ramtane Lamamra Algerian authorities jailed radio journalist Abdessami' Abdelhai for 15 months without charging him after he allegedly helped a newspaper editor flee the country. The editor had been charged with \"\"\"\"endangering national security\"\"\"\" because he publicly discussed president Abdelaziz Bouteflika's health. Here, Wickham points to several other noble defenders of expression who had the courage to attend the rally. U.S. officials were notably absent, but had they showed up, rest assured that they would have made the list too.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0924,"user_ideo":-0.673,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":241,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":4,"json_serial_number":36},{"user_id":1190237177663239,"comment_id":1722544914700058,"date":"2016-06-08","message":"There is no respect.
