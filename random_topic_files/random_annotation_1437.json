The government should be providing for the people only what the free market cannot provide for them, medicine being one of those things, and so I would like to reduce social and entitlement spending we are doing so he is feasible and actually cost efficient. Often cutting government funding costs far more maintaining current levels. The government in my opinion only has two real responsibilities, protecting the people so they can pursue the advancement of our society, and directly funding scientific and technological research. I think we have an in balance of those two responsibilities, with the first being funded far too much and the second far too little. I have a dinner obligation right now and have to go, but I would like to continue this conversation at some point because, although you have made a few reductionist arguments, this has been interesting. I apologize if any of this appears incoherent, because I've been dictating this to my phone.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8742,"user_ideo":-0.5224,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":172,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":5,"json_serial_number":1437},{"user_id":1664014833918562,"comment_id":10154121961529087,"date":"2016-09-27","message":"Absolutely.
