Every single opportunity that a preacher gets to make himself rich off of your tythes, he will take it, and there is nothing that the law will do about it. That opportunity to get rich off of an invisible product is one of the main reasons that religion was invented in the first place. And why do you think that you know Christianity better than anyone else? You are going off of the same book that Benny Hinn goes off of, and other millionaire preachers use to justify skimming. Don't be so sure that you have found the right way.
