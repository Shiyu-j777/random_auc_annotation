With our guns are more important than people lives!!!! Does not matter what the age or where the massacre. Guns and the push of the NRA rally every time. Other civilized countries can and do have better laws on gun control. I'm not a paranoid person who sees shadows and someone coming for them at every turn. What I do see are children gunned down, normal every day people at movies gun down, Universities students gun down, Marines gun down, people in a church gun down. This is real life for us now. Not a TV show. We are in a sad state of affairs. It's not the Presidents fault. He has talked and talked upon every slaughter.
