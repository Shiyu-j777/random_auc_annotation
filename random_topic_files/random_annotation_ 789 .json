What if someone was going into labor? What if someone was rushing to the hospital to spend the last minutes their loved ones have on earth? What if an ambulance got stuck in that traffic?

Funny. Not only is the choice of venue to capture cowardly, they are taking children into the building so they can hide behind them! Such brave men! But language matters! You need to use the proper term for these people. They are domestic treasonous terrorists. They are not a peaceful assembly of protest- those don't involve carrying weapons- and they are not a militia. A militia is a military force that is raised from the civil population to supplement a regular army in an emergency. It is not separatists taking up arms against the lawful government. Taking up arms against the government is treason. So these people are not only terrorists, but are committing treason. Every person over the age of 18 who enters that building needs to be held acountable for their treasonous acts. Every adult or adults who take a minor into that building need to be declared unfit parents and lose parental rights for extreme child endangerment.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0045,"user_ideo":-0.4819,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":13},{"user_id":10102806996778162,"comment_id":10155147833686336,"date":"2017-02-26","message":"I wish all Sheriffs were like David Clarke.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9909,"user_ideo":0.8293,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":144,"index":14},{"user_id":10207983139630415,"comment_id":1131009990310869,"date":"2016-04-06","message":"Funny how Ford calls themselves an American company and yet their founder was a supporter of and provided vehicles to the Nazi Party during WWII.
