Globalization is here to stay. There's nothing Donald Trump can do about it. Slapping higher tariffs on consumer goods only hurts consumers - working people. The resulting downturn in demand would then harm small businesses and new enterprises (they too could see higher supply costs as well). Free trade and globalization (ie, free market economics) aren't the problem. It's the advance of technology that ultimately threatens jobs. What Trump has delivered to Carrier workers is a temporary reprieve from their inevitable obsolescence. Inside 15 years, if not sooner, AI, autonomous machines, and robots will be replacing most Carrier employees. Retraining programmes would go so much farther than the state strong-arming business. The gig economy can help provide many jobs, especially if there's market liberalization allowing disruptive businesses to get a foothold in the economy. The government in the boardrooms and offices of business isn't the path to economic growth or personal liberty.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1312,"user_ideo":-0.35,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":140,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":841},{"user_id":10205284731116093,"comment_id":10153313486867411,"date":"2016-02-10","message":"Oh the comments that spring to mind.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1971,"user_ideo":-0.8464,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":107,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":841},{"user_id":10154476848240712,"comment_id":10152615889590496,"date":"2015-02-24","message":"Please let's not make this a race related story.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2315,"user_ideo":-0.3771,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":203,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":841},{"user_id":1205399996179410,"comment_id":10153967650753734,"date":"2016-02-18","message":"People in this country think they're \"\"\"\"entitled\"\"\"\" to get anything they want.
