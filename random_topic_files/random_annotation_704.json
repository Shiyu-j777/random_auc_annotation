Gen Flynn stated last year that the US Government made a 'wilful decision' to allow ISIS to develop. He also confirmed that the paragraph relating to the Salafist principality that the US wanted in Syria (criminally, obviously, but breaching law and countries' sovereignty is something the US does so often, Washington has forgotten it isn't normal), anyway the paragraph in the Report referring to the Salafist principality the US wanted in Syria, meant ISIS. The truth about the incredibly barbaric terror group ISIS was known in the summer of 2014, and I have often written to the Foreign Office about it. Gen Flynn is a brilliant choice for National Security.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.8626,"user_ideo":-0.1103,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":11},{"user_id":1797942623819216,"comment_id":10154014660694087,"date":"2016-08-19","message":"You have that bass ackwards., or ass backwards.... 4 out of 10 are for Trump...... 6 out of 10 think Trump is a Dick.....","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1935,"user_ideo":-0.3464,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":88,"index":12},{"user_id":10206937737666585,"comment_id":1063079433780535,"date":"2016-07-09","message":"Shut this man up","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4874,"user_ideo":-0.6825,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":233,"index":13},{"user_id":1851659558400247,"comment_id":10153215072689342,"date":"2015-07-14","message":"Arizona State the end","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6986,"user_ideo":-0.0421,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"no","topic_number":95,"index":14},{"user_id":10155134418858332,"comment_id":10159256402460206,"date":"2017-02-25","message":"Next move invade North Korea saying there have wmd vx gas lol","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3886,"user_ideo":0.0491,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":65,"index":15},{"user_id":10211843470627838,"comment_id":10153216614912483,"date":"2015-12-04","message":"Our little guy was not happy to be taking pictures and no amount of holiday cheer was gonna fix that! :)","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1584,"user_ideo":-0.6925,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":134,"index":16},{"user_id":1288853871127511,"comment_id":944563262250813,"date":"2015-01-18","message":"happened to a kid in China when d3 was released if i remember correctly, thats why you gotta take at least 15 min breaks and walk around a bit.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.3025,"user_ideo":-0.7839,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":17},{"user_id":10207172883104763,"comment_id":1842430299320445,"date":"2016-11-17","message":"One what?????","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5179,"user_ideo":0.7911,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":18},{"user_id":10210536162068152,"comment_id":10153839983658188,"date":"2015-12-25","message":"Cool gift - truly blessed a man to have an amazing women by your side - God is Good - Merry Christmas Beck family","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9901,"user_ideo":0.7913,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":43,"index":19},{"user_id":10206749981212560,"comment_id":10150899761689999,"date":"2016-09-12","message":"Senseless nonsense...
