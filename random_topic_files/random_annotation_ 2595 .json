The idea this kid has that he wants to do is good but the way he's trying to go about doing it is completely WRONG( if I am mistaken please correct me but they did not really explain how it was supposed to work in the video). Photosynthesis cannot occur without light and the device he's building is completely sealed from light, unless this device uses some high heat resistant algae that doesn't use light they will be killed by the heat of the engine. The algae have to be resistant to the steam the nitric acid , unburned hydrocarbons and the CO that come out of the tailpipe which would take the acid level out of viable range unless he is using extreme volcanic algae. This idea would be better suited in some kind of air purification tower rather than the end of somebody's tailpipe.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6215,"user_ideo":-0.5096,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":72,"index":1},{"user_id":1117908158256310,"comment_id":679991095522515,"date":"2016-11-21","message":"Drain the swamp!!!!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9893,"user_ideo":0.8541,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":59,"index":2},{"user_id":10157306830555574,"comment_id":10150887041339999,"date":"2016-08-29","message":"Unless is your Nth wedding... Get yourself a wedding photographer (not just any photographer, an actual wedding photographer!). It is after all, a once (or twice, or thrice for some?) in a lifetime event that you want to have amazing pictures of and while yes your family and friends will take photos and all, do you seriously want to leave it to chance? It is hard work, it takes skill, it takes education and practice. Save expenses somewhere else: invite a couple less people, get another venue, maybe even go for other flower arrangements, etc but definitely don't skimp on the photographer!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0106,"user_ideo":-0.6743,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":264,"index":3},{"user_id":1421255947900906,"comment_id":10153764081019117,"date":"2016-08-02","message":"No one should give one penny of my money to a politician I don't support.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4624,"user_ideo":0.3347,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"non-partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":78,"index":4},{"user_id":1450577501635728,"comment_id":740403202816924,"date":"2016-01-31","message":"This guy was executed.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2235,"user_ideo":0.5107,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":182,"index":5},{"user_id":736178036535571,"comment_id":704066566365093,"date":"2015-06-06","message":"Close seaworld","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1824,"user_ideo":-0.5246,"ideology_label":0,"partisan":"partisan","political":"no","topic_number":135,"index":6},{"user_id":10205342228154143,"comment_id":502326049957975,"date":"2015-03-08","message":"I think I'd rather kill myself!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2727,"user_ideo":0.823,"ideology_label":1,"partisan":"partisan","political":"yes","topic_number":38,"index":7},{"user_id":10157207957035032,"comment_id":10156554927635354,"date":"2015-12-28","message":"This mentality of entitlement is quickly becoming the American way.
