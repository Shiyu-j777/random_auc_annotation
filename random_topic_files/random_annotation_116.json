It means keeping guns out of the hands of those who are intent on causing harm to others. It always causes me headaches when ammosexuals say that gun control laws means that the government is going to take away their guns. We have laws regarding vehicles yet the government has never implemented a single law to make vehicles illegal for everyone. In the course of the history of the United States they have only made 2 things absolutely illegal to everyone. The first was alcohol during the Prohibition Era from 1920 to 1933. On December 1933 they repealed the ban on alcohol. The next thing they banned is illicit drugs in the failure known as the War on Drugs which was started by Richard M Nixon.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.001,"user_ideo":-0.8268,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":257,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":116},{"user_id":10154437517719308,"comment_id":10152754134788271,"date":"2015-01-22","message":"I think I might be the only guy in the world who doesn't love this idea.
