Just look at Union salaries and benefits. Plus engineers make a lot more in the US than Europe. Maybe that's why many of them are Europeans. And that doesn't account for material costs. Airbus gets direct government subsidies. Boeing gets tax breaks. Not the same at all in comparison. Boeing is a lot more advanced technology wise. Avionics system. Radar system. Canine comfort. Consumption Efficiency and so on. Emirates airlines the biggest airline in the world ordered 76 billion worth of boeings after canceling a 60 billion deal with Airbus. In 2015 boeings had firm orders for 76 commercial airplanes compare to 28 for Airbus. Sorry I'm not trying to diminish the effort or progress from Airbus because they have made enormous progress but in the end reliability still takes the cake.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5093,"user_ideo":0.3514,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":205,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"right","order_index":7,"json_serial_number":1117},{"user_id":1813045332244446,"comment_id":10153677173634753,"date":"2016-03-20","message":"Aren't God's creation amazing?","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6872,"user_ideo":0.7726,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":135,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":8,"json_serial_number":1117},{"user_id":10209813941681969,"comment_id":1128757087167458,"date":"2016-07-30","message":"Heard there is new initiative.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.5219,"user_ideo":-0.8027,"ideology_label":0,"political":"no","topic_number":66,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":9,"json_serial_number":1117},{"user_id":1004760956295921,"comment_id":10153764744096028,"date":"2016-05-25","message":"The kids???
