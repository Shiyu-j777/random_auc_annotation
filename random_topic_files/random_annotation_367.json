His word is not worth the paper it is written on. Russia had binding agreements with the Ukraine and Georgia and Russia willfully broke all when they invaded and stole away land. The Ukraine trusted the Russians so much that they traded away there nuclear deterrent all for Russia's promise that they would always respect Ukrainian borders and sovereignty. Russia took their nukes and broke their promise. As for Putin being superior to other leaders, how could you possibly know that? Judging by his actions he is a reckless leader who has damaged his nations international reputation and their economy. He is not a superior leader unless you find Machiavellian leaders superior. He has proven himself a dangerous leader. Putin is nothing more than a wealthy oligarch who rules an oligarchy. He has taken his country backwards and not forward. His is a great example of how power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. You are a fool to be a follower in his cult of personality.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0549,"user_ideo":-0.275,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":29,"partisan":"leaning","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":367},{"user_id":177311389349027,"comment_id":627625164072501,"date":"2016-08-14","message":"I legibly he didn't pay any","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0935,"user_ideo":-0.3641,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":238,"partisan":"no","ideology":"left","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":367},{"user_id":1011551558963905,"comment_id":10155794665920389,"date":"2015-06-17","message":"I agree.","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.6713,"user_ideo":0.4859,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":117,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":367},{"user_id":10154901848421729,"comment_id":1241862145854641,"date":"2016-04-08","message":"Many blessings to you!!
