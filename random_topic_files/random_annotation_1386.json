(This happened, rather rarely, among some members of the Army.) * I do not know whether there was some statistical anomaly in the 18th century where there were more slaves owned by Northerners for a brief period, (say sea captains before transferring their \"\"\"\"property\"\"\"\" to farmers), but I doubt it. Even when slavery was legal in the North, it was not economical (which is why Northern states began outlawing slavery much earlier than the general Abolition movement). However, even if more slaves were owned (temporarily) by Northerners, there were never more Northerners than Southerners who owned slaves. The \"\"\"\"typical\"\"\"\" slave owner was more likely to be a farmer who owned one or two field hands than a plantaion owner with dozens, so the number of slave-owners in the South, while small, was still spread across the population, pretty well.\"\"\"\"","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1616,"user_ideo":-0.6301,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":163,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"left","order_index":10,"json_serial_number":1386},{"user_id":10154052865204150,"comment_id":10153046313331749,"date":"2015-04-22","message":"agree! but we need to do more as society to educate our children and future genarations!!!","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.0416,"user_ideo":0.3552,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":13,"partisan":"no","ideology":"right","order_index":11,"json_serial_number":1386},{"user_id":10154072748928153,"comment_id":10153766176344753,"date":"2016-04-20","message":"So ridiculous.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.4571,"user_ideo":0.8445,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":225,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":12,"json_serial_number":1386},{"user_id":10207128271874220,"comment_id":658965250894734,"date":"2016-12-21","message":"He should be eliminated now.!!","prediction":1,"predicted_probs":0.9457,"user_ideo":0.8556,"ideology_label":1,"political":"yes","topic_number":121,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"right","order_index":13,"json_serial_number":1386},{"user_id":1278873625465094,"comment_id":1323175194445396,"date":"2016-10-17","message":"If anyone allows Wikileaks to affect their decision whether or not to vote for Hillary, I've a 100 carat diamond that I will give you for free, just meet me at the place and time of my choosing.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.1155,"user_ideo":-0.7738,"ideology_label":0,"political":"yes","topic_number":214,"partisan":"extreme","ideology":"left","order_index":14,"json_serial_number":1386},{"user_id":1081669365235710,"comment_id":10154236627895496,"date":"2017-02-07","message":"They rose up, and then went down in flames.","prediction":0,"predicted_probs":0.2083,"user_ideo":0.6324,"ideology_label":1,"political":"no","topic_number":7,"partisan":"regular","ideology":"right","order_index":15,"json_serial_number":1386},{"user_id":10207135065438259,"comment_id":1510915898928435,"date":"2016-09-24","message":"Yeah!
